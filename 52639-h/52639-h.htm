<div class="transnote-top">
<p class="center">Transcriber’s Note</p>

<p>Don’t expect standard (or even consistent!) spelling. Any apparent
errors are most probably exactly the way they were printed.</p>

<p>Minor punctuation errors have been corrected without note. Ditto
typesetting errors: word spacing; lower for upper case; transposed,
repeated or missing letters; b/d, u/n etc. The original text used long
s (ſ), rendered here as regular s.</p>

<p>The printer’s somewhat idiosyncratic application of italic type has
been changed to more standard usage, e.g. <i>Moses</i>, not M<i>oses</i>; <i>Deut.
16. 6.</i>, not <i>Deut.</i> 16. 6; for consistency, all footnotes, poetry
and biblical references have been italicised even if not so printed.</p>

<p>Footnote markers have sometimes been moved a few words left or right,
in order to minimise interruption to the flow of the text and/or help
to clarify which word is being referenced.</p>

<p>Greek: Ligatures are expanded to individual letter glyphs. Accents have
been corrected without note.</p>

<p>Hebrew: Misuse of normal/final letter forms has been corrected without
note.</p>

<p>Beyond that, a number of changes are noted <a href="#transnote2">at the end</a>.</p>

and the places which now (through obscurity)
dishearten the Reader, would then become
sweet invitements to an unwearied assiduity in perusing
those sacred Oracles. If my present labour
shall give such light to some obscure passages, that
thereby Gods people shall be drawn on with the
greater delight, to the exercising themselves in
reading of Holy Writ, it shall not repent me of my
tedious travels in these Rites and Customes, of
Generations long since past; which whosoever undertaketh,
shall find the way long and thorny, the
path over-grown and hardly disernable; the
Guides few to direct, and those speaking in strange
Languages; and many apt to discourage him, because
themselves are either lazy, and will not, or
lame and cannot walk the same way. But now
(through Gods assistance) being come to the end of
my Journey, the discoveries made on the way, such
as they are (and such some are, as not observed before)
humbly crave your Lordship’s protection.</i></p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the form of the <span class="antiqua">Hebrewes</span> Common-wealth until
Christ his coming, and when the Scepter departed
from them.</i></span></h3>

<p>The form and state of Government
hath been subject to change and variation
amongst all Nations, but especially
amongst the <i>Jewes</i>, where
these changes are observable.</p>

<p>At first, the <i>Fathers</i> of their several Families, and
their <i>First-born</i> after them, exercised all kind of
Government, both <i>Eclesiastical</i> and <i>Civil</i>, being
both <i>Kings</i> and <i>Priests</i>, in their own houses. They had
power over their own Families, to bless, curse, cast
out of doors, disinherit, and to punish with death, as
is apparent by these examples: of <i>Noah</i> towards <i>Cham</i>,
<i>Gen. 9. 25.</i> of <i>Abraham</i> towards <i>Hagar</i> and <i>Ismael</i>,
<i>Gen. 21. 10.</i> of <i>Jacob</i> towards <i>Simeon</i> and <i>Levi,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
Gen. 49. 3.</i> and of <i>Judah</i> towards <i>Thamar</i>, <i>Gen. 38. 24.</i></p>

<p>In <i>Moses</i> his days then did this prerogative of primo
geniture cease: and as <i>Aaron</i> and his posterity
was invested with the right and title of <i>Priests</i>; so <i>Moses</i>,
and after him <i>Joshua</i>, ruled all the people with a
kind of <i>Monarchical</i> authority. For <i>Moses</i> was among
the righteous as <i>King</i>, <i>Deut. 32. 5.</i></p>

<p>After <i>Joshua</i> succeeded <i>Judges</i>; their Officers were
of absolute and independent authority, like unto
<i>Kings</i>, when once they were elected. But there were
long vacancies, and chasms commonly between the
cessation of the one, and the election of the other:
yea for the most part, the people never chose a <i>Judge</i>,
but in time of great troubles, and imminent dangers;
which being over-past, he retired to a private life.
After that <i>Gideon</i> had delivered the people out of
the hand of the <i>Midianites</i>, he being offered the
<i>Kingdom</i>, replyed, I will not reign over you, neither
shall my Child reign over you, <i>Judg. 8. 23.</i> That of
<i>Samuel</i>, that he judged <i>Israel</i> all the days of his life,
<i>1 Sam. 7. 15.</i> was<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> extraordinary. In this respect,
their <i>Judges</i> symbolize with the <i>Roman Dictators</i>.
This state of Regiment continued amongst them by
the computation of S. <i>Augustine</i><a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>, three hundred
twenty nine years. In these vacancies or distances of
time between <i>Judge</i> and <i>Judge</i>, the greater and
weightier matters were determined by that great
Court of the <i>Seventy</i> called the <i>Senadrin</i>; in which
respect the form of Government may be thought
<i>Aristocratical</i>. <i>Kings</i> succeeded the <i>Judges</i>, and they
continued from <i>Saul</i> unto the Captivity of <i>Babylon</i>,
that is,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> about 502 years.</p>

<p>From the Captivity unto the coming of Christ,
(which time is thought<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> to have been five hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
thirty six years) the state of the <i>Jewes</i> became
very confused. Sometimes they were ruled by <i>Deputies</i>
and <i>Vicegerents</i>, who had not supream authority
in themselves, but as it pleased the <i>Persian Monarchs</i>
to assigne them; they were termed<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> ‎‏ראשי גליות‏‎
<i>Rasche galiuth</i>, αἰχμαλωτάρχαι <i>Heads of the Captivity</i>.
Of this sort was <i>Zorobabel</i> and his successors, who are
reckoned in the <i>Hebrew</i> Chronicles<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> to be these,

which are thought to have reigned under the <i>Persian

as likewise the other succeeding ten chief Governours
after <i>Alexander</i> the Great. In the last of these
ten, the government departed from the House of <i>David</i>,
and was translated to the <i>Macchabees</i>, who descended
from the Tribe of <i>Levi</i>. They were called

a <i>Proselyte</i>, never so before,<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> yea now also the <i>Law-giver</i>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Publicans.</i></span></h3>

<p>Wee having seen the most remarkable changes
in the Common-wealth of the Hebrews;
we will note the chief Observations concerning the
persons there inhabiting: and first concerning the
<i>Publicans</i>, who were, in the latter times, an heterogeneous
Member of that Common-wealth. After
that the <i>Jews</i> became Tributary to <i>Rome</i>, (which<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
was effected by <i>Pompey</i> threescore years before
the Birth of our Saviour) certain Offices were
appointed by the Senate of <i>Rome</i>, unto whom
it belonged, as well among the <i>Jews</i> as in other
Provinces, to collect, and gather up such custome-money
or tribute, as was exacted by the
Senate. Those that gathered up these publique payments,
were termed <i>Publicani</i>, <i>Publicans</i>; and by reason
of their covetous exactions, they commonly were
hated by the People of the Provinces:<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> Every
Province had his several <i>Societie</i>, or company of
<i>Publicanes</i>: Every <i>Society</i> his distinct <i>Governour</i>: in
which respect it is, that <i>Zacheus</i> is called by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
<i>Evangelists</i>, ἀρχιτελώνης <i>princeps Publicanorum</i>, <i>the chief
Receiver of the tribute</i>, or <i>chief Publican</i>, <i>Luke 12. 2.</i>
And all the Provincial Governours in these several
Societies, had one chief<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> <i>Master</i> residing at <i>Rome</i>,
unto whom the other subordinate Governours gave
up their accounts. These <i>Publicans</i> were hated in
all Provinces, because of their exactions; but chiefly
in the Commonwealth of the <i>Jews</i>, because though
it were chiefly maintained by the <i>Galileans</i>, yet it
was generally inclined unto by the <i>Jews</i>, That tribute
ought not to be payed by them: this hatred is confirmed
by that <i>Rabbinical</i> proverb,<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> <i>Take not a
Wife out of that family wherein there is a Publican, for
such are all Publicans</i>. Yea a faithful <i>Publican</i> was so
rare at <i>Rome</i> it self, that one <i>Sabinus</i> for his honest
managing of that Office, in an honourable remembrance
thereof, had certain images erected with this
superscription<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>; Καλῶς τελωνήσαντι, <i>For the Faithful

<i>Publicans</i> and <i>sinners</i> go hand in hand.</p>

<p>It is now generally received as a truth undoubted,
that not only <i>Heathen</i> people, but sometimes <i>Jews</i>
themselves became <i>Publicanes</i>. <i>Tertullian</i> was of another
opinion,<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and thought that all the <i>Publicans</i>
were <i>Heathens</i>; but he hath been in that long since
confuted by <i>Jerome</i><a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>, and reason it self perswadeth
the contrary. First, <i>Matthew</i> who was a <i>Publican</i>,
was afterwards an <i>Apostle</i>, and therefore unlikely to
have been an Heathen. Secondly, <i>Zacheus</i> his name
was a pure <i>Hebrew</i> name having no affinity with <i>Roman</i>
names. Thirdly, the ground or principal argument
on which <i>Tertullian</i> built, was meerly<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> erroneous.</p>

he that was born an <i>Hebrew</i>, either by <i>Fathers</i> or

<p>The <i>Hebrews</i> were of two sorts; some lived in <i>Palestina</i>,
and used the <i>Hebrew</i> Text, these were called
<i>Hebrews</i> or <i>Jews</i>; others were dispersed in divers places
of <i>Greece</i>, they used the <i>Greek</i> translation, and
thence were termed Έλληνισταὶ<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> <i>Grecists</i>. S. <i>Luke</i>
mentioneth both. There arose a murmuring, τῶν Έλληνιστῶν
of the <i>Græcists</i>, towards the <i>Hebrews</i>, <i>Acts
6. 1.</i> Where note the difference between Ἕλληνες, and
Έλληνισταὶ, the <i>Græcians</i>, and the <i>Græcists</i>. The <i>Græcians</i>
are used by Saint <i>Paul</i>, to signifie all the <i>Heathen
people</i>, and stand in opposition with <i>Hebrews</i> in the
general acception, containing both <i>Græcists</i>, or dispersed
<i>Hebrews</i>, and also those of <i>Palestina</i>: the <i>Græcists</i>
were both by birth and religion <i>Hebrews</i> standing
in opposition with <i>Hebrews</i>; in the strict acception,
taken for those of <i>Palestina</i>.</p>

<p>The whole body of <i>Israel</i> was divided into twelve
Tribes, and publique Records were kept, wherein<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
every ones Genealogy was registred, to manifest
unto what particular tribe he belonged. These records
<i>Herod</i> burnt, hoping that in after ages he might
be thought originally an <i>Israelite</i>, if those publike
Monuments might not be produced against him.
Thus much <i>Eusebius</i><a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> plainly delivereth of him. I
am of opinion, that another reason might be admitted;
namely, That no distinction either of Tribe or
Family, might appear; but, all being unfounded,
and amongst the rest <i>Davids</i>, (unto whose Family by
a peculiar right this Scepter belonged) <i>Herod</i> and his
posterity might be the better secured of the Kingdom.</p>

<p><i>Prosylites</i> were those Heathen people, who disclaiming
<i>Paganism</i>, became Converts, and joyned
themselves unto the Church of the <i>Jews</i>. They were
termed <i>Prosylites</i> ἀπὸ τοῦ προσεληλυθέναι, from their coming
and adjoyning unto the <i>Jews</i>. Concerning these
<i>Prosylites</i>, we will consider these three things. 1. The
several kinds of <i>Prosylites</i>; 2. The manner of making
them; 3. In what account or respect they lived among
the <i>Jews</i>.</p>

<p>First, the kinds of <i>Prosylites</i> were two; ‎‏גר ברת‏‎ <i>Ger
berith</i>, <i>Prosylitus fœderis</i>, <i>A Prosylite of the Covenant</i>.
He submitted himself unto the Circumcision, and
to the whole <i>Mosaical</i> Pædagogy.<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The <i>Rabbies</i>
term such a one ‎‏גר צדק‏‎ <i>Ger tsedeck</i>, <i>Proselytum justitiæ</i>,
<i>A Prosylite of righteousness</i>. Secondly, ‎‏גר שער‏‎
<i>Ger sahagnar</i>, <i>Proselytus portæ</i>, <i>A Prosylite</i>, or <i>stranger
within thy gates</i>, <i>Deut. 14. 21.</i> Of him also we read
in the fourth Commandment. He was suffered to
dwell amongst them; whence he is also called ‎‏תושב‏‎
<i>Toschab</i>, <i>Incola</i>, an Inhabitant. He was not circumcised,
neither did he conform himself to the <i>Mosaical</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
rites, and ordinances, only he was tyed to the obedience
of those Commandments, which among the
<i>Hebrew Doctors</i> go under the name of <i>Noahs</i> seven
Commandments;<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> which they reckon thus:
1. Judgements or Punishments for Malefactours.
2. Blessing the name of God; under this is contained
the keeping of the Sabbath. 3. Disclaiming of Idolatry.
4. Uncovering ones nakedness. 5. Shedding of
blood. 6. Robery. 7. Eating of any member of a
beast, taken from it alive. Of this sort, were <i>Naaman</i>
the <i>Syrian</i>, the <i>Eunuch</i>, <i>Cornelius</i>, and those of whom
we read, That there were dwelling at <i>Jerusalem</i>,
<i>Jews</i> <i>Men that feared God</i><a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> of every Nation under

things were required. 1. <i>Circumcision.</i><a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> 2. <i>A kind of
purification by water.</i> 3. <i>The blood of Oblation.</i> This <i>oblation</i>
was commonly two Turtles or Pigeons. To the
making of a <i>Woman Proselyte</i>, were required only
<i>purification by water</i>, and <i>Oblation</i>.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Now because
the <i>Jews</i> have neither Altar, nor Sacrifice, they say
that for the <i>Males Circumcision</i>, and <i>purification by
water</i> sufficeth; and for the <i>Females</i>, only <i>purification
by water</i>.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> In <i>Davids</i> time, they say that many thousands
of <i>Prosylites</i> were joyned unto the <i>Church</i> without
<i>Circumcision</i>, by this <i>purification</i>.</p>

<p>Hence we may observe, that a kind of <i>Initiation
by water</i> was long in use among the <i>Jews</i>, though it
were not <i>Sacramental</i> until Christ his institution: yea
therefore it may seem to have been used by them,
because they expected it at the coming of the <i>Messias</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
as appeareth by their coming unto <i>John</i>, questioning
not so much his <i>Baptism</i>, as his <i>Authority</i>, by
what <i>authority</i> he baptized: <i>Why baptizest thou them, if

<i>Prosylite</i> should be eligible into the Court of their

<span class="smaller"><i>Of their Kings.</i></span></h3>

<p>We shall read of three sorts of <i>Kings</i> in the
Old Testament. <i>Melchisedeck</i> was King and
<i>Priest</i>; <i>David</i> <i>King</i> and <i>Prophet</i>; others simply <i>Kings</i>.
<i>Melchisedeck</i> was <i>King</i> and <i>Priest</i>, <i>David</i> <i>King</i> and
<i>Prophet</i>. The concurrence of <i>Princely Sovereignty</i>,
and <i>Holy Orders</i>, in the same man, intimates that supreme
Authority should alwayes be accompanied
with care of Religion: In which respect <i>Joash</i>, when
he was anointed <i>King</i>, received the Testimony, or
Book of the Law, <i>2 King 11. 12.</i> Neither did these
two meet only in <i>Melchisedeck</i> &amp; <i>David</i>, but the same
man among the <i>Heathens</i><a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> was oftentimes <i>King</i> and
<i>Priest</i>. And the <i>Trismegistus</i> had his name <i>Ter maximus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
because he was <i>Philosophus maximus, Sacerdos maximus,
&amp; Rex maximus</i>. All Kings were not anointed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
but onely those in whom succession was broken; and
there the first of the family was anointed for his Successor,
except in case of dissention, where there was
required a renewed unction, for the confirmation of
his Authority. For this reason it was, that <i>Solomon</i>
was anointed as well as <i>David</i>, because of the strife
between him and <i>Adonijah</i>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, <i>Saul</i> and <i>Jehu</i> were anointed ‎‏בפך‏‎
<i>Bepac</i>, with a <i>cruse</i> of Oyl, to shew the short continuance
of their Kingdoms. <i>David</i> and <i>Solomon</i> were

<p>As Kings were distinguisht from the People by
many Ensigns of Honour, by their Crown, their
Scepter, their Throne, <i>&amp;c.</i> so likewise were they distinguished
by their Apparel; that was the reason
that <i>Ahab</i> entring into battel, changed his apparel,
<i>1 Kings 22. 30.</i> Though purple and white colours
were not appropriated unto <i>Kings</i>,<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> yet these colours
were in chief esteem, and principally used by
them,<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> yea <i>Purple</i> above others was affected by
the <i>Emperours</i> and Nobility of <i>Rome</i>; and <i>white</i> by the
Nobility of the Jews: whence the <i>Hebrews</i> term their
Noble men, and such as were of best rank ‎‏חורים‏‎ <i>Chorim</i>,

men of meaner rank, ‎‏חשוכים‏‎ <i>Chaschucim</i>, <i>Sordidatos</i>,

atth. 27. 28.</i> and <i>Herod</i> the <i>Tetrarch</i> of <i>Galilee</i> put

<span class="smaller"><i>The High-priest, Priests, Levites, and
Nethinims.</i></span></h3>

<p>There were three ranks and degrees of Ministers
about the Temple; <i>Priests</i>, <i>Levites</i>, and <i>Nethinims</i>;
they may be paralleld with <i>Ministers</i>, <i>Deacons</i>,
and <i>Sub-Deacons</i>, in the Primitive Church: Over all
these, the <i>High-priest</i> was chief.</p>

<p>In <i>Aaron</i> and his posterity was continued the succession
of the <i>Priests</i>; the <i>High-Priesthood</i> was tied to
the line of his first-born; all the rest of his posterity
were <i>Priests</i>, simply so called, or called <i>Priests of the
second Order</i>, <i>2 Kings 23. 4.</i></p>

<p>Except <i>Aaron</i>, and those that issued from his
loines, (in whom the <i>series</i> of <i>Priests</i> was continued)
all the rest of <i>Levi</i> his posterity were called <i>Levites</i>.</p>

<p>Both in the <i>High-priest</i>, and the <i>second</i> or <i>Inferiour
Priests</i>, there are two things considerable. First, their
<i>Consecration</i>. Secondly, their <i>Office</i>. In both these,
somewhat they <i>differed</i>, in somewhat they <i>agreed</i>.</p>

<p>In their <i>Consecration</i> they differed. First,<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The
<i>High-priest</i> was <i>anointed</i>: the materials of this
Chrism or oyntment are prescribed, <i>Exod. 30. 23.</i>
It was poured upon <i>Aarons</i> head, <i>Levit. 8. 12.</i> It ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
down to his beard, and to the border of his garments,
<i>Psalm. 133. 2.</i> The <i>Second Priests</i> were only <i>sprinkled</i>
with this oyle, mixed with the blood of the Sacrifice,
<i>Levit. 8. 30.</i> In this was typed out the unction of
our <i>Saviour</i>, who was <i>anointed</i> with the oyl of Gladness
above his Fellows, <i>Psal. 45. 8.</i> He was <i>anointed</i>
above his Fellows, <i>Extensive</i>, and <i>Intensive</i>, <i>Extensive</i>,
for though <i>Aaron</i> was <i>anointed Priest</i>, <i>Saul</i> anointed
<i>King</i>, <i>Elisha</i> anointed <i>Prophet</i>, <i>Melchisedeck</i> <i>King</i> and
<i>Priest</i>, <i>Moses</i> <i>Priest</i> and <i>Prophet</i>, <i>David</i> <i>King</i> and <i>Prophet</i>;
yet none save only <i>Christ</i>, <i>King</i>, <i>Priest</i>, and <i>Prophet</i>.
<i>Intensive</i>, he was <i>anointed</i>, we <i>sprinkled</i>. He was
<i>full</i> of grace and truth, <i>John 1. 14.</i> And from his <i>fulness</i>
we received grace for grace, <i>ver. 16.</i> And all
Christians, especially Ministers, are unto <i>God</i> the
sweet savour of <i>Christ</i>, <i>2 Cor. 2. 5.</i></p>

<p>Secondly, they differed in their Garments, which
were a necessary adjunct to their <i>Consecration</i>. The
<i>High-Priest</i> wore at the time of his ordinary ministration
in the <i>Sanctuary</i>, eight Garments, <i>Exodus 28.</i>
First, <i>Breeches of linnen</i>, put next upon his flesh. Secondly,
<i>A Coat of fine linnen</i> put over the breeches.
Thirdly, <i>A girdle embroidered, of fine linnen, blew purple,
&amp; scarlet</i>, wherewith the coat was girded. Fourthly,
<i>A Robe all of Blew</i>, with seventy two bells of Gold,
and as many Pomegranates of blew purple, and scarlet,
upon the skirts thereof; this was put over the
coat and girdle. Fifthly, <i>An Ephod of gold and of blew
purple, scarlet, and fine linnen curiously wrought</i>; on the
shoulders thereof were two fair <i>Beryl</i> Stones, engraven
with the names of the Twelve Tribes of <i>Israel</i>.
This <i>Ephod</i> was put over the Robe, and girded thereto
with a curious girdle made of the same. Sixthly,
<i>A Breast-plate wrought of gold, blew, purple, scarlet, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
fine linnen</i>, which being a span square, was fastened
by gold chains and rings, upon the <i>Ephod</i>: herein
were set <i>twelve</i> several Stones, on which the names of
the <i>twelve Tribes</i> were engraven: Moreover, in this
Breast-plate were the <i>Urim</i> and the <i>Thummim</i> placed.
Seventhly, <i>A Miter of fine linnen, sixteen cubits
long, wrapped about his head</i>. Eighthly, <i>A plate of purple
gold, or holy Crown two fingers broad</i>, whereon was
engraven <i>Holiness to the Lord</i>: this was tyed with a
blew lace upon the fore-front of the <i>Miter</i>.</p>

<p>These eight Garments the <i>High-Priest</i> used in his
ordinary ministration, and they are termed by the
<i>Rabbies</i>, ‎‏בגדי זהב‏‎, <i>Bigde Zahab</i>, <i>Vestimenta aurea</i>,
<i>Golden Vestments</i>, because of their richness in comparison
of other extraordinary Garments, which he
wore onely once a year, when he entred into the
<i>Holy of Holies</i>, upon the Propitiation day, <i>Lev. 15. 4.
23.</i> These latter are called ‎‏בגדי לבן‏‎ <i>Bigde Laban</i>, <i>Vestimenta
alba</i>, <i>White Garments</i>; there were in number
four. 1. <i>A linnen breeches.</i> 2. <i>A linnen coat.</i> 3. <i>A linnen
girdle.</i> 4. <i>A linnen Miter</i>, <i>Levit. 16. 4.</i></p>

<p>In the time of the Second <i>Temple</i>,<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> because the
<i>Chrism</i> or holy Oyl could not be found, therefore, as
formerly in respect of his <i>unction</i>, the <i>High-Priest</i> was
called by the <i>Talmudists</i>, ‎‏מתרבה משחה‏‎ <i>Mithrabe
Mischa</i>, <i>Auctus unctione</i>, <i>The anointed</i>; so when the
Oyl was lost in regard of his <i>Garments</i>, he was
termed, ‎‏מתרבה בגדים‏‎ <i>Mithrabe Begadim</i>, <i>Auctus Vestibus</i>,
<i>The cloathed</i>. Those forementioned Garments<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
the <i>High-Priest</i> might not wear abroad in the
City, unless some urgent occasion compelled him, as
<i>Simeon</i> the <i>just</i> did, when he went forth to meet <i>Alexander</i>
the Great.</p>

<p>In his apparel the threefold Office of our <i>Saviour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Christ</i> was shadowed: the <i>Crown</i> signified his <i>Kingly</i>
Office; the <i>Urim</i> and <i>Thummim</i>, and likewise his
<i>Bells</i> and <i>Pomegranates</i>, his <i>Prophetical</i> Office: by <i>Urim</i>
and <i>Thummim</i>, he answered as from an <i>Oracle</i>;
by the <i>Bells</i> was typed the sound of his Doctrine; by
the <i>Pomgranates</i>, the sweet savour of an Holy Life;
the <i>Names</i> of the twelve <i>Tribes engraven</i> on the <i>Ephod</i>,
and the <i>Brest-plate</i>, signified his <i>Priestly</i> Office, presenting
unto <i>God</i> the whole <i>Church</i>, for which he
maketh intercession. He knoweth his own sheep by
<i>Name</i>, <i>John 10. 3.</i></p>

<p>The <i>inferiour Priests</i> had onely four Garments,
which they used in their ministration. 1. <i>A linnen
breeches.</i> 2. <i>A linnen coat.</i> 3. <i>A linnen Girdle.</i> 4. <i>A
linnen bonnet</i>, <i>Exod. 28.</i></p>

<p>Thirdly they differed in their <i>marriage</i>. The <i>High-priest</i>
might not marry a <i>Widow</i>, nor a <i>divorced Woman</i>,
nor a <i>Harlot</i>, but a <i>Virgin</i>, <i>Levit. 21. 14.</i> From
a <i>Widow</i> he could not expect the <i>first love</i>: from a <i>divorced
Woman</i> he could not expect the <i>first, or just
love</i>: from an <i>Harlot</i>, neither <i>first</i>, <i>just</i>, nor <i>only love</i>:
all which <i>Christ</i> (whom the <i>High-Priest</i> did herein represent)
expecteth from his <i>Church</i>. The other <i>Priests</i>
might lawfully marry a <i>Widow</i>, <i>Levit. 21. 7.</i></p>

<p>The <i>High-priest</i>, and the <i>Inferiour Priests</i> agreed
in their <i>consecration</i> in these particulars. It was required
first, that both should be void of bodily blemish,
<i>Levit. 21. 17.</i> Secondly, that both should be presented
unto the Lord at the door of the <i>Tabernacle</i>, <i>Exod.
29. 4.</i> Thirdly, that both should be washed with water,
<i>Exod. 29. 4.</i> Fourthly, that both should be consecrated
by offering up certain Sacrifices, <i>Exod. 29.</i>
Fifthly, that both should have of the blood of the
other Ram, put upon the tip of the right ear, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
thumb of the right hand, and the great toe of the
right-foot, <i>Exod. 29. 20.</i></p>

<p>In the time of their <i>Consecration</i>, certain pieces of
the sacrifice were put into the <i>Priests</i> hand, <i>Exod. 29.
9.</i> The ceremony in the <i>Christian Church</i>, used by the
<i>Bishop</i> unto the <i>Minister</i> in time of <i>Ordination</i>, <i>that the
Bishop</i> giveth the <i>Bible</i> into the hands of the <i>Minister</i>,
doth much resemble this. And both may signifie, that
no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that
is called of <i>God</i>, as was <i>Aaron</i>, <i>Heb. 5. 4.</i> Hence <i>Consecration</i>
in the <i>Hebrew</i> phrase is termed, <i>Filling of the
hand</i>. And contrary to this did <i>Jeroboams Priests</i>, whosoever
would, he <i>Filled his own hand</i>, <i>1 King. 13. 33.</i>
that is, <i>He thrust himself into the Priesthood</i>.</p>

<p>In the discharge of their offices, the <i>High-Priest</i>
differed from the other <i>Priests</i>: First, because he
onely, and that but once a year, entred into the <i>Holy
of Holies</i>, <i>Exod. 16. 34.</i></p>

<p>Secondly, the <i>High-Priest</i> might not mourn for the
death of his neerest kin, <i>Levit. 28. 10, 11.</i> The phrases
used there to express mourning are two. First, <i>uncovering
the Head</i>. Secondly, <i>Renting the Cloaths</i>: Of both
these somewhat is spoken in the Chapter of <i>Burial</i>;
but concerning the latter it will not be amiss to note,
that the <i>Talmudists</i> determine the matter thus; saying,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
That it was lawful for the <i>High-Priest</i> to tear
the skirt, or neither part of his Garment, but from
the bosom downward it was unlawful: which if it
be true, then it doth not necessarily follow, that <i>Caiaphas</i>
did contrary to the law in renting his clothes,
<i>Matth. 26. 65.</i> <i>The inferiour Priests</i> might mourn for
these six; <i>Father</i>, <i>Mother</i>, <i>Son</i>, <i>Daughter</i>, <i>Brother</i>, and
<i>Sister, that had no Husband</i>. <i>Levit. 21. 2.</i></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_47" id="Footnote_47"></a><a href="#FNanchor_47"><span class="label">[47]</span></a> <i>Vide Cunæum
de rep. Heb. lib.
2. cap. 3.</i></p>

</div>

<p>In the discharge of their Offices, the <i>High-Priest</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
other <i>Priests</i> agreed in these Particulars: First, they
both burnt incense and offered sacrifices, <i>1 Chron. 6.
49.</i> Secondly, they both sounded the Trumpets, the
use whereof was two-fold; sometimes to sound an
alarm in the war, sometimes, to assemble the people
and their Rulers, <i>Numb. 10.</i> Thirdly, they both slew
the sacrifice, <i>2 Chron. 29. 22.</i> Fourthly, they both
instructed the people, <i>Malac. 2. 7.</i> Fifthly, they both
judged of leprosie, <i>Levit. 13. 2.</i></p>

<p>For the more orderly performance of these offices,
the <i>High-Priest</i> had his Suffragan,<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> called ‎‏סגן‏‎
<i>Sagan</i>, who in case of the <i>High-Priest</i>’s pollution, performed
his office. Of this sort was <i>Zephaniah</i>, <i>Jer.
52. 24.</i> And of this sort <i>Annas</i> is thought to have
been, when <i>Caiaphas</i> was <i>High-Priest</i>.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> In this sense
they interpret <i>Annas</i> and <i>Caiaphas</i> to have been
<i>High-Priests</i> the same year, <i>Luk. 3. 2.</i> The <i>High-Priest</i>
and his <i>Sagan</i>, resembled our <i>Bishop</i> and his <i>Suffragan</i>:
The <i>Patriarch</i> of <i>Constantinople</i> and his <i>Primore</i>
termed <i>Protosyncellus</i>, and amongst the <i>Romans</i>, the
<i>Centurion</i> and his <i>Optio</i>: for the <i>Lieutenants</i> in war,
who in case of necessity supplyed the <i>Centurions</i> place,
were termed <i>Optiones</i>.</p>

<p>That every one of the inferiour <i>Priests</i> might equally
serve in his order, King <i>David</i> distributed the
whole company of them into twenty four ranks
or courses, called ἐφημερίαι <i>Turmæ</i>, <i>vices</i>. <i>Nadab</i> and
<i>Abihu</i> being dead, there remained onely two sons
to <i>Aaron</i>, namely, <i>Eleazer</i> and <i>Ithamar</i>; now as the
succession of <i>Priests</i> was preserved in these two families,
so did <i>David</i> at this time according to the
number of people in each family, make his division.
<i>Eleazers</i> family he divided into sixteen ranks, and
<i>Ithamars</i> into eight: the division was by <i>Lot</i>; the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
<i>Lot</i> fell to <i>Jehoiarib</i>, the second to <i>Jedaiah</i>, the third
to <i>Hairim</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>1 Chron. 24.</i> Every rank or course served
weekly in the Temple by turn, and the ranks
received their names from those who at that time
were the heads of the several families, and ever after
retained the same names. The chief of every rank
was called, <i>Summus Sacerdos istius Classis</i>: <i>The chief
Priest of that rank</i>. Hence it is, that we read of many
<i>High-Priests</i> assembled together, <i>Mark 14. 1.</i> Furthermore
we are to note, that as the weekly course fell
out by lot, so did they by lot determine each particular
<i>Priests</i> service; namely, who should burn incense,
who slay the beasts, who lay them on the Altar,
who dress the lamps, <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>Zacharias</i> was of the
<i>course of Abia</i>, <i>Luke 1. 5.</i> that is, of the <i>eighth course</i>,
and his lot was to burn incense, <i>Luke 1. 9.</i></p>

<p>The office of the <i>Levites</i> was to pitch, to take down,
to bear up and down the <i>Tabernacle</i>, and the vessels
thereof. <i>Levi</i> had three sons, <i>Gershon</i>, <i>Cohath</i>, and
<i>Merari</i>: and accordingly the whole company of the
<i>Levites</i> were distinguisht into 3 orders, <i>Gershonites</i>,
<i>Cohathites</i>, and <i>Merarites</i>. The <i>Gershonites</i> charge was
to carry the coverings, and hangings of the <i>Tabernacle</i>.
The chief things within the Sanctuary were
committed to the <i>Cohathites</i>. The Wood-work, and
the rest of the instruments were committed to the
charge of the <i>Merarites</i>, <i>Num. 3.</i> This was the office of
the <i>Levites</i>, in <i>Moses</i> his time, whiles they were on
their journey, in the Wilderness; but afterward
when they were setled in the promised Land, then
<i>David</i> changed their office, appointing them, some
to have the charge of the Treasures of the <i>Temple</i>,
<i>1 Chron. 26. 20.</i> others to be Over-seers and <i>Judges</i>,
others to be Porters, others Singers, <i>1 Chron. 23. 4.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
The Singers in time of singing were clad in linnen
Robes or Surplesses, <i>2 Chron. 5. 12.</i> The Singers were
divided into twenty four <i>orders</i> or <i>courses</i>, <i>1 Chron. 25.
8.</i> And the Porters into as many, <i>1 Chron. 26.</i> that
both might supply their turns weekly by lot, as the
<i>Priests</i> did. In <i>Moses</i> time also, their <i>consecration</i> began
at the <i>five and twentieth</i> year of their age: In <i>Davids</i>
at the <i>twentieth</i>, <i>1 Chron. 23. 24.</i> <i>Ezra 3. 8.</i> Here
we may note the liberty granted unto the Church in
changing Ceremonies: the Office of the <i>Levites</i> in
<i>Davids</i> time, was not the same as in <i>Moses</i>: and again,
<i>Moses</i> and <i>David</i> agreed not in the time of their
<i>consecration</i>. Again in the Christian Church we shall
find in <i>Matthias</i> his election, the use of <i>Lots</i>; not so
in <i>Pauls</i>, or any other of the <i>Apostles</i>: In their meetings,
use of an <i>holy-kiss</i>; and at the Lords Supper,
use of their <i>Love-feasts</i>: both now antiquated thoroughout
Christendom.</p>

<p>Moreover, there are certain <i>degrees</i> observable
among the <i>Levites</i>: First, their <i>Initiation</i>, when they
were a month old, they were <i>Initiated</i> and presented
unto God, <i>Numb. 3. 15.</i> Secondly their <i>consecration</i>,
they were <i>consecrated</i> by imposition of hands, when
they were five and twenty years old, <i>Numb. 8. 24.</i>
From thence for five years following, they learned
their Office. Those that imposed hands on them are
said in the Text, <i>Numb. 8. 10.</i> to be the <i>sons of Israel</i>,
<i>Ghazkuni</i> interpreteth that place, the <i>First born of
Israel</i>. They were the Representive Church; and
in allusion to this, the Church of Christ is called the
<i>Church of the First-born</i>, <i>Heb. 12. 23.</i> At the same
time the <i>Levites</i> were <i>waved</i> by the <i>Priests</i>, that is, as
the Greek reads it,<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> <i>Separated</i>, which word is
used for the <i>Ministers of Christ</i>,<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> <i>Separate me <span class="antiqua">Barnabas</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and <span class="antiqua">Paul</span></i>, <i>Act. 13. 2.</i> Thirdly, their <i>Ministration</i>,
to carry up and down the <i>Tabernacle</i>, and this was
at the thirtieth year of their age, until the fiftieth,
<i>Numb. 4. 3.</i> Lastly, their <i>vacation</i>, or <i>discharge</i> from
that laborious service of carrying the <i>Tabernacle</i>;
notwithstanding even then they were to serve in
their charge, to encamp round about the Tent, to
sing, and to beware that no stranger came into the
Temple,<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and likewise to over-see and instruct
younger <i>Levites</i> in the manner of <i>Bishops</i>. Unto
these degrees the Apostle seemeth to have respect:
They that have ministred well, get themselves a
good <i>degree</i>, <i>1 Tim. 3. 13.</i> The like kind of<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> <i>degrees</i>
are observable among the <i>Vestal Virgins</i>: they
remained in their Nunnery thirty <i>years</i>. <i>Ten years</i>
they learned the Mysteries of their Profession; <i>Ten
years</i> they exercised them; and <i>Ten years</i> they taught
them others. From this custome of <i>Imposing hands</i>
on the <i>Levites</i> hath flow’d the like custom, used
by the <i>Apostles</i> in conferring Orders, <i>Acts 6. 6.</i> <i>1 Tim.
5. 22.</i></p>

<p>Observe the difference of these three phrases,
Χειροθεσία, the <i>imposition of hands</i>. Χειροτονία, the <i>holding up
of hands</i>, in token of <i>elivation</i> or <i>ordination</i>, <i>Act. 14. 22.</i>
And ἔκτασις χειρῶν, <i>A stretching forth of the hands</i>. Both

<p>There were<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> another sort of holy persons termed ‎‏אנשי מעמד‏‎
<i>Ansche Magnamad</i>, <i>Viri stationarii</i>; the
Law requiring, that whosoever offered either gift or
sacrifice, he should present it unto the Lord with his
own hands, and <i>stand by</i> during the time of his oblation.
Now, because all <i>Israel</i> could not <i>stand by</i>, for
the narrowness of the Place, hence when an offering
was made for all the people, certain selected Persons,
chosen for that purpose, supplied the stead of all the
People. They were divided, as the <i>Priests</i> and <i>Levites</i>,
into twenty four <i>ranks</i> and <i>orders</i>, weekly to
minister in the <i>Temple</i>, but the choice was not restrained
to the <i>Tribe of Levi</i>, but was indifferently made out
of the <i>people</i>. Every <i>rank</i> had one <i>fore-man</i>, chief
above the rest, termed<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> <i>Stationum Princeps</i>, the
<i>Fore-man of the Station</i>. The <i>Nethinims</i> office was to
be hewers of wood, and drawers of water for the
house of <i>God</i>, they were not <i>Levites</i>, no nor <i>Israelites</i>,
but <i>Gibeonites</i>, whom because of their fraudulent
dealing, <i>Joshua</i> made in this manner tributary, <i>Josh. 9.
23.</i> They were afterward called <i>Nethinims</i>, <i>Ezra 2. 43.</i>
from ‎‏נתן‏‎ <i>Nathan</i>, which signifieth to <i>give</i>, because they
were given to the service of the <i>Temple</i>. Their Office
was vile and base, as appeareth by that proverbial
speech; From the hewer of thy wood, unto the
drawer of thy water. <i>Deut. 29. 11.</i></p>

<p>There are divers names given unto the Expositors
of the Law; and although the Particular
year or time when each name began, be not clearly
evidenced by Monuments of <i>Antiquity</i>, yet in general
we may conceive three distinct periods of time;
in which the names altered. First from <i>Adam</i> until
<i>Moses</i>; Secondly, from <i>Moses</i>, till the peoples return
from <i>Babylon</i>. Thirdly, from their <i>return</i>, until
the dayes of <i>Christ</i>, and after. In the first period, as
<i>Adam</i> was <i>Prophet</i> and <i>Priest</i> in his family, so afterward
every <i>first-born</i> supplyed these two offices together
with the <i>princely</i> office in their several families.
That they ruled their families as <i>Kings</i> and instructed
them as <i>Prophets</i>, is clear to any acquainted with
Scripture; the greatest doubt is, what sufficient
proof there is for their <i>Priest-hood</i>, <i>Adams Priest-hood</i>,
is gathered hence,<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> because that <i>Gen 4. 3.</i> and <i>4.</i>
<i>Abel</i> and <i>Cain</i> are said to have brought their sacrifices:
to have brought them, namely, unto <i>Adam</i>,
who offered them unto God in their name. The
<i>Priest-hood</i> of the <i>first-born</i> is gatherable hence, because
the <i>Levites</i> were appointed to the service of the Altar,
instead of the first-born, and as the λύτρον or
price of <i>redemption</i>, <i>Num. 3. 41.</i> In the second period,
though a <i>private Catechetical exposition</i> of the Law
belonged to the <i>Masters of Families</i>, yet the <i>publick
Ministerial exposition</i> thereof was appropriated to
<i>Priests</i> and <i>Prophets</i>. In the third period, when Prophecy
ceased, then the office of expounding Scripture
was more common, and instead of <i>Prophets</i> came in
a multitude of other Expositors; In general we
may call them <i>teachers of Israel</i>, <i>Joh. 3. 10.</i> We may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
distinguish them into three several sorts. 1. <i>Wisemen.</i>
2. <i>Scribes.</i> 3. <i>Disputers.</i> The <i>Apostle</i> compriseth them
all, <i>1 Cor. 1. 20.</i> Where is the <i>Wise</i>? Where is the
<i>Scribe</i>? Where is the <i>Disputer</i>? Unto any of these, or
whatsoever other <i>Doctor</i> eminently gifted above others,
the title <i>Rabbi</i> was prefixed. First, of their <i>Prophets</i>.
Secondly, their <i>Wisemen</i>. Thirdly, their <i>Scribes</i>.
Fourthly, their <i>Disputers</i>. Fifthly, their <i>Rabbies</i>.</p>

<p>To <i>prophesie</i>, or to be a Prophet, hath divers acceptions
in Scripture. First, it is taken for the <i>books</i> and
writings <i>of the Prophets</i>. They have <i>Moses</i> and the
<i>Prophets</i>, <i>Luk. 16. 29.</i> Secondly, for the whole Word
of <i>God</i>: no Prophesie in the Scripture is of any private
motion, <i>2 Pet. 1. 20.</i> Thirdly, those unto whom God
vouchsafed familiarly to reveal himself, they are
called <i>Prophets</i>: <i>Abraham</i> was a <i>Prophet</i>, <i>Gen. 20. 7.</i> and
<i>Miriam</i> a <i>Prophetess</i>, <i>Exod. 50. 20.</i> Fourthly, ordinary
Interpreters of the Word are called <i>Prophets</i>. He that
receiveth a <i>Prophet</i> in the name of a <i>Prophet</i>, <i>Mat. 10.
14.</i> Lastly, it is taken for those, who are enabled by
Divine Revelation, to lay open hidden secrets, transcending
all possibility of humane search. Hence it is
that <i>Prophets</i> in old time were called <i>Seers</i>, <i>1 Sam. 9.
9.</i> And their <i>Prophecy</i> was termed a <i>vision</i>, <i>Esay. 1. 1.</i>
because <i>God</i> extroardinarily enlightned their minds
with the knowledge of these secrets.</p>

<p>There are three observable names applied to <i>prophecy</i>
in <i>Scripture</i>. 1. <i>Verbum Domini</i>: 2. <i>Visio</i>: 3. <i>Onus</i>,
<i>The Word of the Lord</i>: <i>Vision</i>: <i>A Burthen</i>. The first importeth
the <i>Lord speaking</i>, or revealing his secrets;
the second implyeth the <i>Prophets attending</i>, or beholding
them; the third being applyed onely to
<i>Judgements</i>, signifieth the <i>burthensomness</i> of them on
that people against whom they came forth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>For the propagation of Learning, <i>Colledges</i> and
<i>Schools</i> were in divers places erected for the <i>Prophets</i>;
their <i>Scholars</i> were termed<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> <i>Filii prophetarum</i>,
<i>children of the Prophets</i>, <i>2 Kin. 6. 1.</i> unto which phrase
there is allusion, <i>Matt. 11. 19.</i> <i>Wisdom is justified of
her children</i>: by reason of this Relation the <i>Prophet</i>
sometimes is called a <i>Father</i>; <i>Elisha</i> cryed out, My
<i>Father</i>, my <i>Father</i>, <i>2 King. 2. 12.</i> The <i>Targum</i><a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> expoundeth
that place, <i>Rabbi, Rabbi</i>; as much as to say,
my <i>Master</i>, my <i>Master</i>: And in truth the <i>Rabbies</i> grew
very ambitious of the name <i>Father</i>, which was the
reason of our Saviours speech, <i>Matth. 23. 6.</i> <i>Call no
man <span class="antiqua">Father</span> upon earth</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Scripture</i><a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> sometimes joyneth to the name
of the <i>Prophet</i>, the name of his <i>Father</i>, as <i>Hosea the son
of Beeri</i>, <i>Hos. 1. 1.</i> And such a one the <i>Hebrews</i> confess
to be both a <i>Prophet</i>, and the <i>son of a Prophet</i>.
Sometimes it mentioneth the <i>Prophets</i> name, but not
the <i>Fathers</i>; such a one they confess to be a Prophet,
but not the <i>son of a Prophet</i>: Sometimes it mentioneth
with the <i>Prophet</i>, the name of the <i>City</i> where he
prophesied, and then it followeth, that he was a <i>Prophet
of that City</i>. When a Prophet is mentioned
without the <i>name of the City</i>, then he is thought to be
a <i>Prophet of Jerusalem</i>.</p>

<p>2. <i>Wisemen</i>: This title though in it self it be general
and common to all <i>Doctors</i>, and <i>Teachers</i> of
the Law; yet for many years before our Saviours Incarnation,<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
it was either arrogated by the Pharisees,
or else by the ignorant multitude appropriated
unto them, for an opinion of their extraordinary <i>wisdom</i>,
in teaching of Traditions, which they preferred
beyond the Law. Hence the Pharisees were called<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
<i>Masters of the Traditions</i>: And hence was that
councel of <i>R. Eleezer</i> to his Scholars,<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> that they
should forbid their children from the study of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
<i>Bible</i>, and place them between the knees of their
<i>wisemen</i>. Likewise<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> hence, when any of their <i>Doctors</i>
did read Lectures, their saying was, οἱ σοφοὶ ἡμῶν
δευτεροῦσι, <i>Our wisemen do teach traditions</i>. The like
ambition we shall find among the <i>Grecians</i>, all of
them striving to be intituled Σοφοὶ, <i>Wisemen</i>: and
hence, whensoever the chief of them had pleased the
people in performance of their Orations, or any
other publick business, they were honoured with
a <i>Grand</i> Σοφῶς, that is, with a loud acclamation of
σοφῶς, σοφῶς, <i>Well done</i>, or <i>wisely done</i>; until <i>Pythagoras</i>,
in dislike of such swelling Titles, stiled himself <i>Philosophus</i>,
<i>a Lover of wisdom</i>; which kind of modesty was
afterward practised by the <i>Hebrew Doctors</i>; for they
in after times, to avoid the suspicion of arrogancy,
refused the name of ‎‏חכמים‏‎ <i>Chacamim</i>, <i>Wisemen</i>,<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
and stiled themselves, ‎‏תלמידי חכמים‏‎ <i>Discipuli sapientium</i>,
<i>Learners of wisdom</i>.</p>

<p>3. <i>Scribes</i>: This name was given to two sorts of
men, some meerly <i>Laicks</i>, others <i>Clergy-men</i>. The body
of the <i>Laick Scribes</i>, were those, to whom was committed
the instruction of young children in their minority,
especially to teach them to write; we may
English them Scriveners. This office was appropriated
to the Tribe of <i>Simeon</i>. In this sense we read not
of <i>Scribes</i> in the Scripture, although the ground of
their first institution hath been taken thence, namely,
from those words which <i>Jacob</i> used unto <i>Simeon</i> and
<i>Levi</i>; I will divide them in <i>Jacob</i>, and scatter them in
<i>Israel</i>, <i>Gen. 49. 7.</i> So that as <i>Levi</i> had no portion, but
lived dispersed among the other Tribes, by the benefit
of the Altar.<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> In like manner <i>Simeon</i> had no
portion in the judgement of the <i>Hebrews</i>, but lived
scattered among the other tribes, getting their maintenance
by teaching and schooling little children:
Whether this office of teaching children was appropriated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
to them, I leave to the inquiry of others; certain
I am that the <i>Simeonites</i> had their own inheritance
by lot, <i>Josh. 19. 1.</i> And the prophecy concerning
their being scattered is thought to have been accomplished
in this, that the inheritance of the <i>Simeonites</i>,
was taken out of the portion of the children
of <i>Judah</i>, <i>Josh. 19. 9.</i> Furthermore it is certain, that if
not all Scriveners, yet those publick Notaries, who
were imployed in drawing Deeds, and writing Contracts
(be they of what Tribe they will) they were
called by the name of <i>Scribes</i>. Unto this there is allusion,
<i>Psal. 45. 1.</i> My tongue is as the <i>pen</i> of a swift
<i>Writer</i>, or <i>ready Scribe</i>. Out of the body of these I
conceive certain choice men to have been elected
for publick imployments; some to attend the King,
as his Secretaries, termed, γραμματεῖς βασιλέως, the Kings
Scribes, <i>2 Kin. 12. 10.</i> Such were <i>Sheia</i>, <i>2 Sam. 20. 25.</i>
And <i>Shaphan</i>, <i>2 Kin. 22. 3.</i> Others to attend the publick
Courts and Consistories: they much resembled
our <i>Clarks of Assizes</i>, these were termed, γραμματεῖς λαοῦ
the <i>Scribes of the people</i>, <i>Mat. 2. 4.</i> <i>It.</i> <i>1. Mac. 5. 42.</i></p>

they were Expositors of the Law, and thence are they
called γραμματεῖς τοῦ νόμου, νομικοὶ, &amp; νομοδιδὰσκαλοι, <i>Scribes
of the Law</i>, <i>Esra. 7. 9.</i> <i>Expounders of the Law</i>, <i>Luk. 7. 30.</i>
and <i>Doctors of the Law</i>, <i>Luk. 5. 17.</i> Their Office was to
write, read, and expound the Law of <i>Moses</i> to the
people. The name was a name of <i>Office</i>, not of <i>Sect</i>. Of
this sort was <i>Esdras</i>, <i>Esra 7. 6.</i> who though he were a
<i>Levite</i>, yet<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> others there were of the Tribe of <i>Judah</i>,
and, as it is thought, they might indifferently be of
any Tribe. The name was of the like esteem among
the <i>Hebrews</i> as the <i>Magi</i> were among the <i>Chaldeans</i>;
the <i>Quindecemviri</i> among the <i>Romans</i>, for expounding
<i>Sybilla’s Oracles</i>: Or the <i>Canonists</i> in the <i>Church of
Rome</i>. The word ‎‏סופרים‏‎ <i>Sopherim</i>, translated <i>Scribes</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
signifieth <i>Numberers</i>, or <i>Computers</i>, and is applyed to
the <i>Masorites</i>, because they spent their time in reckoning,
and numbring, not onely the verses, but the
words also, and letters of each Book throughout the
<i>Bible</i>; which, as it is an argument of their industry,<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>
so likewise of <i>Gods</i> providence, in the preservation
of his truth inviolable. As the <i>Wise men</i> in their
Preaching pressed Traditions; so the <i>Scribes</i> clave to
the written word, whence they were termed<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> <i>Text-men</i>,
or <i>Masters of the Text</i>. And to this purpose it is
worth our observing, that whereas both the Scribes
and the Pharisees sought to fasten accusations upon
our Saviour, <i>Mat. 9.</i> The Scribes accused him of blasphemy,
<i>v. 3.</i> The Pharisees of eating with Publicans
and sinners, <i>v. 11.</i> The Scribes accusation was a breach
of the Law; the Pharisees a breach of Traditions.</p>

<p>3. The <i>Disputer</i>.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> He insisted upon <i>Allegories</i>, and
searched out mystical interpretations of the Text.
Hence himself was termed <i>Durschan</i>, and his exposition,

<span class="smaller"><i>Of their Title Rabbi.</i></span></h3>

<p>About the time of our Saviour Christ his Nativity,
Titles began to be multiplied; and amongst
the rest, these of <i>Rab</i>, <i>Ribbi</i>, <i>Rabbi</i>, and <i>Rabban</i>,
were in especial use: they all are derived from ‎‏רבב‏‎
<i>Rabab</i>, signifying, <i>multiplicatus fuit</i>, and they
sound as much as πολυμαθέστατος, that is, a <i>Master</i>, or
<i>Doctor</i> eminently gifted with variety of Knowledge.
Concerning these titles, they write thus,<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> that <i>Rabbi</i>
is a more excellent title than <i>Rab</i>, and <i>Rabban</i> more
excellent then <i>Rabbi</i>; and the simple name without any
title, as <i>Haggai</i>, <i>Zachary</i>, <i>Malachy</i>, was more excellent
than <i>Rabban</i>. About this time they used a set form of
Discipline in their Schools. The Scholar was termed ‎‏תלמיד‏‎,
<i>Talmid</i>, a <i>Disciple</i>, in respect of his Learning; ‎‏קטן‏‎
<i>Katan</i>, a <i>Junior</i>, in respect of his minority; ‎‏בחור‏‎
<i>Bachur</i>, that is, one <i>chosen</i>, or <i>elected</i> in respect of his
<i>election</i>, or <i>cooptation</i>, into the number of Disciples;
After he had proved a good Proficient, and was
thought worthy of some degree, then was he by imposition
of hands made a <i>Graduate</i> ‎‏חבר‏‎ <i>Chaber</i>, a <i>Companion</i>
to a <i>Rabbi</i>. This imposition of hands, they
termed ‎‏סמכה‏‎, <i>vel</i> ‎‏סמיכות‏‎, <i>Semicah</i>, or <i>Semicuth</i>,
which Ceremony they observed in imitation of <i>Moses</i>
towards <i>Joshua</i>. The Lord said unto <i>Moses</i>, Take
thou <i>Joshua</i> the son of <i>Nun</i>, in whom is the Spirit, and
<i>put thine hand upon him</i>, <i>Numb. 27. 18.</i> At which time
he that imposed hands on him, used this form of
words,<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> <i>I associate thee, and be thou associated</i>. After this
when he was worthy to teach others, then was he
called <i>Rabbi</i>, and whereas in his minority, his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
name being suppressed, he was called onely by his
<i>Fathers name</i>, <i>the son of N.</i> When he was made <i>Graduate</i>
by <i>imposition of hands</i>, then was he called by his
<i>own name</i>, <i>N. the son of N.</i> And afterward when he
was thought worthy to teach, then was the Title
<i>Rabbi</i> prefixed, after this manner; <i>Rabbi N. the son of
N.</i> For example, <i>Maimonides</i>; at first was termed onely
<i>Ben Maimon</i>, the son of <i>Maimon</i>; after his degree, then
was he called by his own name, added to his fathers,
<i>Moses Ben Maimon</i>, <i>Moses the son of Maimon</i>: at last being
licenced to teach, then was he called ‎‏רמבם‏‎ <i>Rambam</i>,
which abbreviature consisting of Capital Letters,
signifeth, <i>Rabbi Moses Ben Maimon</i>, <i>Rabbi Moses
the son of Maimon</i>. So <i>Rabbi Levi</i>, the son of <i>Gersom</i>, in
his minority was called <i>the son of Gersom</i>, afterward
<i>Levi the son of Gersom</i> at last, ‎‏רלבג‏‎ <i>Ralbag</i>, <i>Rabbi Levi
the son of Gersom</i>. This distinction of <i>Scholars</i>, <i>Companions</i>,
&amp; <i>Rabbies</i>, appeareth by that speech of an ancient
<i>Rabbi</i>, saying,<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> <i>I learned much of my Rabbies, or
Masters, more of my companions, most of all of my Scholars</i>.
That every <i>Rabbi</i> had Disciples, and that his own
Disciples, and other well-wishers stiled him by the
name of <i>Rabbi</i>, in the dayes of our Saviour, needeth
no proof. <i>Judas</i> came to <i>Christ</i> and said, <i>God save
thee Rabbi</i>, <i>Mat. 26. 49.</i> In like manner <i>Johns Disciples</i>
came and saluted <i>John</i> by the name of <i>Rabbi</i>, <i>John 3.
26.</i> and <i>Christ</i> by the name of <i>Rabbi</i>, <i>John 1. 38.</i> But
whether there was such a formal imposition of hands
then in use, I much doubt. The manner of their
meetings, when Disputations were had in their Synagogues,
or other Schools, was thus.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The
chief <i>Rabbies</i> sate in reserved Chairs; these are those
chief seats of the Synagogues, which the Scribes and
Pharises so affected, <i>Mat. 23. 6.</i> Their <i>Companions</i> sate
upon Benches or lower Forms; their Scholars on the
ground at the feet of their Teachers. Saint <i>Paul</i> was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
brought up at the feet of <i>Gamaliel</i>, <i>Act. 22. 2.</i> And <i>Mary</i>
sate at <i>Jesus feet</i>, and heard his word, <i>Luk. 10. 39.</i> The
positure of their body differed according to their degrees.
The <i>Rabbi</i> is described<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> to be ‎‏יושב‏‎ <i>Joscheb</i>,
one that <i>sitteth</i>: the <i>Companion</i>, ‎‏מוטת‏‎ <i>Muteth</i>, the
word signifieth a kind of leaning upon a bed or bench,
ones head lying in the others bosome, in manner of the
ancient sitting at table; and it was a deportment
of the body, inferiour to that of <i>sitting</i>: The
Scholar was termed<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> ‎‏מתאבק‏‎ <i>Mithabek</i>, one that doth
lie along in the dust, and this was a token of the Scholars
humility, thus humbling and subjecting himself even
to the feet of his Masters: This same custom
it is thought,<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> Saint <i>Paul</i> laboured to bring into the
Christian Church, <i>1 Cor. 14.</i> Their Scholars were not
all of equal capacity, whence they said,<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> some had
<i>conditionem spongiæ</i>, others <i>clepsydræ</i>, others <i>sacci fæcinacei</i>,
and others <i>cribri</i>. Some resembled the <i>Sponge</i>,
and suck’d in all that they heard without judgment;
others the <i>Hour-Glass</i>, they took in at one ear, and let
out at the other; others the <i>Winesack</i>, through which
Wine is so drained from the dregs, that only the dregs
remain behind: Lastly, others the <i>Rying-sieve</i>, which
in winnowing lets out the courser seed, and keepeth
in the corn.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of their Nazarites and Rechabites.</i></span></h3>

<p>There are two sorts of <i>Votaries</i> mentioned in
the Old <i>Testament</i>; <i>Rechabites</i>, <i>Jerem. 35.</i> and
<i>Nazarites</i>, <i>Numb. 6.</i> I find scarce any thing warrantable
concerning these two, more than what
the Scripture delivereth in the fore-quoted places:
therefore concerning the matter of their Vows, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
refer the Reader to the aforesaid Texts of Scripture;
here only we will note the distinction of <i>Nazarites</i>.
The first are these <i>Votaries</i>, termed so from ‎‏נזר‏‎
<i>Nazar</i>, to separate, because they separated themselves
from three things; <i>First</i>, from Wine, and all things
proceeding from the Vine. <i>Secondly</i>, from the Razor,
because they suffered no Razor to come upon their
head, but let their hair grow all the dayes of their separation.
<i>Thirdly</i>, from pollution by the dead: this
separation again was twofold, either for a set number
of days, or for a mans whole life; that they termed
<i>Naziræatum dierum</i>, this, <i>Naziræatum seculi</i>: of
that sort was <i>Paul</i>, and those four with him, <i>Acts
21. 24.</i> Of this sort was <i>Sampson</i> <i>Judges 13.</i> and <i>John
Baptist</i>. The just number of days, how long the former
of these two separated themselves, is not expressed
in <i>Scripture</i>, but the <i>Hebrew Doctors</i><a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> determine
them to be thirty, because it is said, <i>Num. 6. 5.</i> <i>Domino
sanctus</i>, ‎‏יהיה‏‎ <i>erit</i>; which word (say they) containing
thirty, expresseth the just number of days to
be observed in this voluntary separation. The second
sort of <i>Nazarites</i>, were so termed from ‎‏נצר‏‎
<i>Natsar</i>, from whence cometh <i>Natsareth</i>, or <i>Nazareth</i>,
the name of a certain Village in <i>Galilee</i>; where Christ
was conceived and brought up: Hence our Saviour
himself was called a <i>Nazarene</i>, or <i>Nazarite</i>, <i>Mat. 2. 23.</i>
and those that embraced his Doctrine, <i>Nazarites</i>, <i>Acts
24. 5.</i> Afterward certain <i>Hereticks</i> sprung up, who as
the <i>Samaritanes</i> joyned <i>Jewish ceremonies</i> with <i>Heathenish</i>
Rites: so<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> they joyned together <i>Christ</i> and
<i>Moses</i>, the <i>Law</i> and the <i>Gospel</i>; <i>Baptism</i> and <i>Circumcision</i>:
of the beginning of these we shall read, <i>Acts
15. 2.</i> Then came down certain from <i>Judæa</i>, and
the brethren, saying, <i>Except ye be circumcised after the
manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved</i>. These Hereticks
were called <i>Nazarites</i>, either of malice by the <i>Jewes</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
to bring the greater disgrace upon <i>Christian</i> religion;
or else because at first they were true, though weak
<i>Nazarites</i>, that is, <i>Christians</i> mis-led by <i>Peters Judaizing</i>
at <i>Antioch</i>, <i>Gal. 2. 11.</i> And hence it is<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> that the
<i>Church</i> at <i>Antioch</i>, in detestation of this new-bred heresie,
fastened upon them by the name of <i>Nazarites</i>,
forsook that name, and called themselves <i>Christians</i>,
<i>Acts 11. 26.</i> <i>Symmachus</i>, that famous Interpreter of the
<i>Old Testament</i>, was a strong Defender of this heresie,
and<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> from him in after times they were named
<i>Symmachiani</i>. The <i>Jews</i> had them in as great hatred
as the <i>Samaritanes</i>; whereupon<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> three times every
day, at <i>morning</i>, <i>noon-tide</i>, and <i>evening</i>, they closed
their Prayers with a solemn execration, <i>Maledic Domine
Nazaræis</i>. Lastly, another sort of <i>Nazarites</i> there
were, so termed from ‎‏נזר‏‎ <i>Nazar</i>, signifying to <i>abolish</i>
or <i>cut off</i>;<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> because they did <i>abolish</i> and <i>cut off</i> the
five books of <i>Moses</i>, rejecting them as not <i>Canonical</i>.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Assideans.</i></span></h3>

<p>It is much controverted, whether the <i>Assideans</i>
were <i>Pharisees</i> or <i>Essenes</i>, or what they were. Were
I worthy to deliver my opinion, or, as the <i>Hebrews</i>
Proverb is, To thrust in my head among the heads of
those wise men; I conceive of the <i>Assideans</i> thus:
Before their captivity in <i>Babylon</i>, we shall find the
word ‎‏חסידים‏‎ <i>Chasidim</i>, (translated <i>Assidæi</i>, <i>Assideans</i>)
to signifie the same as, ‎‏צדיקים‏‎ <i>Tsaddikim</i>, <i>Just</i>, or <i>good
men</i>: both were used promiscuously, the one for the
other, and both stood in opposition to the ‎‏רשעים‏‎ <i>Reschagnim</i>,
that is, <i>ungodly</i> or <i>wicked men</i>. At this time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
whole body of the <i>Jews</i> were distinguished into two
sorts, <i>Chasidim</i>, and <i>Reschagnim</i>, <i>good</i>, and <i>bad</i>.</p>

<p>After their captivity, the <i>Chasidim</i> began to be distinguished
from the <i>Tsadikim</i>.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The <i>Tsadikim</i> gave
themselves to the study of the Scripture. The <i>Chasidim</i>
studied how to <i>add unto the Scripture</i>.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> Secondly,
The <i>Tsadikim</i> would conform to whatsoever the
Law required. The <i>Chasidim</i> would be <i>holy above the
Law</i>. Thus to the repairing of the Temple, the maintenance
of sacrifices, the relief of the poor, <i>&amp;c.</i> they
would voluntarily add over and above, to that
which the Law required of them. Whence it is noted,
that those were <i>Chasidim</i> who would say, <i>What
is mine, is thine; and what is thine, is thy own</i>: those
<i>Reschagnim</i>, which would say, <i>What is thine is mine;
and what is mine, is my own</i>. And it is probable, that
the middle sort mentioned in the same place, who
would say, <i>what is mine, is mine; what is thine, is
thine own</i>, were the very <i>Tsadikim</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>At this time the body of the <i>Jews</i> were distinguished
into three sorts, in respect of holiness. First, <i>Reschagnim</i>,
ἀσεβεῖς, <i>Wicked</i> and <i>ungodly men</i>. Secondly,
<i>Tsadikim</i>, δίκαιοι, <i>Just</i> and <i>righteous men</i>. Thirdly, <i>Chasidim</i>,
who are sometimes translated ὅσιοι, <i>Holy men</i>, and
that for the most part:<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> but sometimes also ἀγαθοὶ,
<i>Goodmen</i>: These of all others were best reputed, and
beloved of the people. The Apostle shewing the
great love of Christ, dying for us, amplifieth it by
allusion unto this distinction of the people: Christ
died for the <i>ungodly</i>. Scarcely for a <i>righteous man</i>
will one die, yet peradventure for a <i>good man</i> some
would even dare to die, <i>Rom. 5. 6, 7.</i> The gradation
standeth thus; Some peradventure would die, for
one of the <i>Chasidim</i>, a <i>good man</i>: scarcely any, for one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of <i>Tsadikim</i>, a <i>just</i>, or <i>righteous man</i>; for the <i>Reschagnim</i>,
or <i>ungodly</i>, none would die: Yet Christ dyed
for us <i>ungodly</i>, being sinners, and his enemies.</p>

<p>Now as long as these Works of supererogation remained
arbitrary, and indifferent, not required as
necessary, though preferred before the simple obedience
to the Law; so long the heat of contention was
not great enough to breed Sects and Heresies: But
when once the Precepts and Rules of supererogation
were digested into <i>Canons</i>, and urged with an opinion
of necessity; then from the <i>Chasidim</i> issued the
brood of <i>Pharisees</i>;<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> and also from them (as it is
probably thought) the Heresie of the <i>Essenes</i>, both
obtruding unwritten Traditions upon the People, as
simply necessary, and as a more perfect rule of sanctity
than the Scripture. At this time the <i>Tsadikim</i> in
heat of opposition rejected not only Traditions, but
all Scripture, except only the five books of <i>Moses</i>; for
which reason they were called <i>Karaim</i>. Some are
of opinion,<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> they rejected only <i>traditions</i>, and embraced
all the books of Scripture: Which opinion soever
we follow; they had their name ‎‏קראים‏‎, <i>Karaim</i>,
<i>Textuales</i>, <i>Scriptuarii</i>, i. <i>Text-men</i>, or <i>Scripture-readers</i>,
because they adhered to Scripture alone, withstanding
and gain-saying <i>Traditions</i> with all their
might. And if we follow the latter, then all this while
the <i>Karaim</i> were far from Heresie: but in process of
time, when from <i>Sadock</i>, and <i>Baithus</i>, these <i>Karaim</i>
learned to deny all future rewards for good works,
or punishment for evil, or resurrection from the dead;
now the <i>Karaim</i> became compleat <i>Sadduces</i>, and perfect
<i>Hereticks</i>, taking their denomination from their
first Author <i>Sadok</i>. The time of each Heresies first
beginning, shall be more exactly declared in their
several Chapters.</p>

<p>There are<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> three Opinions concerning the
<i>Etymology</i> of the name <i>Pharisee</i>. The first are
those which derive it from ‎‏פרש‏‎ <i>Parash</i>, <i>Expandere</i>,
<i>Explicare</i>; either from the enlarging and laying open
their Phylacteries, or from their <i>open performance</i>
of good works in publick view of the People, as being
ambitious of mans praise. Secondly, from ‎‏פרש‏‎
<i>Parasch</i>, <i>Exponere</i>, <i>Explanare</i>; because they were of
chief repute; and counted the profoundest <i>Doctors</i>
for the <i>exposition</i> of the Law, so that they were termed<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
<i>Peruschim</i>, <i>quia</i> <i>Poreschim</i>; <i>Pharisees</i>, because
they were <i>Expounders</i> of the Law. Thirdly, others
derive the name from the same Verb, but in the conjugation
<i>Piel</i>, where it signifieth <i>dividere</i>, <i>separare</i>, to
<i>separate</i>.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> In this acception, by the <i>Greeks</i> they were
termed ἀφωρισμένοι, we may <i>English</i> them <i>Separatists</i>.
Their <i>separation</i> is considerable, partly in the particulars
<i>unto which</i>, partly in those <i>from which</i> they <i>separated</i>.</p>

<p>First, They <i>separated themselves to the study of the
Law</i>, in which respect they might be called, ἀφωρισμένοι
εἰς τὸν νόμον, <i>Separated unto the Law</i>. In allusion
unto this, the <i>Apostle</i> is thought<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> to have stiled
himself, <i>Rom. 1. 11.</i> ἀφωρισμένον εἰς εὐαγγέλιον, <i>Separated
unto the Gospel</i>: when he was called from being a
<i>Pharisee</i>, to be a <i>Preacher of the Gospel</i>; and now not
<i>separated unto the Law</i>, but to the <i>Gospel</i>.</p>

<p>Secondly, They <i>separated</i> themselves, or at least pretended
a<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> <i>separation to an extroardinary sanctity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
life above other men</i>. God, I thank thee, that I am

<p>The particulars, <i>from which they separated themselves</i>,
were these.</p>

<p>First, <i>From commerce with other people</i>, as afterward
will appear in their Traditions: whence they called
the common people, by reason of their ignorance, ‎‏עם הארץ‏‎
<i>populum terræ</i>, the <i>people of the earth</i>. In the
Gospel of Saint <i>John 7. 49.</i> they are called ὄχλος.
<i>This people</i> who knoweth not the Law are cursed.</p>

<p>Secondly,<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> <i>From the apparel and habit of other
men</i>: for they used particular kinds of Habits, whereby
they would be distinguished from the vulgar.
Hence proceeded that common speech, <i>Vestes populi
terræ, conculcatio sunt Pharisæorum</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_97" id="Footnote_97"></a><a href="#FNanchor_97"><span class="label">[97]</span></a> <i>R. David. Sophon.

</div>

<p>Thirdly,<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> <i>From the customs and manners of the
world</i>. This heresie of the <i>Pharisees</i> seemeth to have
had its first beginning in <i>Antigonus Sochæus</i>. He being
a <i>Pharisee</i>, succeeded <i>Simon the Just</i>; who was Coetanean
with <i>Alexander</i> the Great: he lived three
hundred years before the birth of Christ.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_98" id="Footnote_98"></a><a href="#FNanchor_98"><span class="label">[98]</span></a> <i>Thisbites.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Pharisees</i> were<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> not tied to any particular
Tribe or Family, but indifferently they might be of
any; S. <i>Paul</i> was a <i>Benjaminite</i>; <i>Hyrcanus</i> was a <i>Levite</i>.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
Each Sect had its <i>Dogmata</i>, his proper <i>Aphorisms</i>,
<i>Constitutions</i>, or <i>Canons</i>: so the <i>Pharisees</i> had
theirs. My purpose is, both concerning these and
the other Sects, to note onely those <i>Canons</i>, or <i>Aphorisms</i>,
wherein chiefly they were heretical, and one
differing from the other.</p>

</div>

<p>First, The <i>Pharisees</i><a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> ascribed <i>some things</i> to
<i>Fate</i>, or <i>Destiny</i>, and <i>some things</i> to mans <i>Free-will</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>Secondly, They confessed that there were <i>Angels</i>,
and <i>Spirits</i>, <i>Acts 23. 8.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>Thirdly, Concerning the resurrection of the dead,
they acknowledged it, and taught<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> that the souls
of evil men deceased, presently departed into everlasting
punishiment; but the souls, they say, of good
men, passed by a kind of Pythagorean μετεμψύχωσις
into other good mens bodies. Hence it is thought<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
that the different opinions concerning our Saviour
did arise; Some saying that he was <i>John Baptist</i>; others,
<i>Elias</i>; others, <i>Jeremias</i>, <i>Matth. 16. 14.</i> As if Christ his
body had been animated by the soul either of <i>John</i>,
<i>Elias</i>, or <i>Jeremias</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>Fourthly, They did stifly maintain the Traditions of
their <i>Elders</i>. For the better understanding what their
<i>Traditions</i> were, we must know that the <i>Jews</i> say the
Law was <i>twofold</i>,<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> one committed to writing,
which they called ‎‏תורה שבכתב‏‎ <i>Thorah schebitchtah</i>, <i>The
written Law</i>; the other delivered by tradition, termed
by them, ‎‏תורה בעל פה‏‎ <i>Thorah begnal pe</i>. They say
both were delivered by <i>God</i> unto <i>Moses</i> upon Mount
<i>Sanai</i>, the latter as an exposition of the former, which
<i>Moses</i> afterward delivered by mouth to <i>Joshua</i>, <i>Joshua
to the Elders, the Elders to the Prophets, the Prophets
to those of the great Synagogue</i>, from whom successively
it descended to after-ages. These Traditions were
one of the chief Controversies between the <i>Pharisees</i>,
and the <i>Sadduces</i>.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> The <i>Pharisees</i> said, <i>Let us maintain
the Law which our fore fathers have delivered into
our hands, expounded by the mouth of the wise men, who
expounded it by tradition</i>. And lo, the <i>Sadduces</i> said,
<i>Let us not believe or hearken to any tradition or exposition,
but unto the Law of <span class="antiqua">Moses</span> alone</i>. The Traditions
which they chiefly urged, were these;</p>

</div>

<p>1. <i>They would not eat until they washed their hands</i>,
Why do thy Disciples transgress the Tradition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
the <i>Elders</i>? for they wash not their hands when they
eat bread, <i>Mat. 15. 2.</i> This washing is said to have been
done πυγμῇ <i>Mar. 7. 3.</i> that is, <i>often</i>, as some translate
the word, taking πυγμῇ in this place, to signifie the
same as πύκα in <i>Homer</i>, <i>frequenter</i>. Others translate
the word <i>accurate</i>, <i>diligenter</i>, intimating the great
care and diligence they used in washing: with this
the <i>Syriack</i> Text<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> agreeth. Others<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> think that
there is, in the phrase, allusion unto that rite or manner
of washing in use among the <i>Jews</i>, termed by them ‎‏נטילת ידים‏‎
<i>Netilath iadaim</i>, the <i>lifting up of their hands</i>.
The <i>Greek</i> word πυγμὴ is thought to express this rite,
because in this kind of washing, <i>They used to joyn the
tops of the fingers of each hand together with the thumb</i>,
so that each hand did after a sort resemble τὴν πυγμὴν
i. a <i>fist</i>. This Ceremony was thus performed: First,
they washed their hands clean. Secondly, they composed
them into the fore-mentioned form. Thirdly,
they lifted them up, so that the water ran down
to the very elbows. Lastly, they let down their hands
again, so that the water ran from off their hands
upon the earth.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> And that there might be store of
water running up and down, they poured fresh water
on them when they lifted up their hands, and
poured water twice upon them when they hanged
them down. Unto this kind of washing <i>Theophylact</i>
seemeth to have reference, when he saith, that the
<i>Pharisees</i> did<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> <i>cubitaliter lavare</i>, <i>wash up to their elbows</i>.
Lastly, others<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> interpret πυγμὴ, to be the fist, or
hand closed, &amp; the manner of washing thereby denoted
to be <i>by rubbing one hand closed in the plain or hollow
of the other</i>. All imply a diligent and accurate care
in washing: the ceremonious washing by lifting up the
hands, and hanging them down, best expresseth the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
superstition, which only was aimed at in the reproof,
though all the sorts of washing, to the <i>Pharisee</i> were
superstitious, because they made it not a matter of
outward <i>decency</i> and <i>civility</i>, but of <i>religion</i>, to eat
with washt or unwasht hands, urging such a necessity
hereof,<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> that in case a man may come to some water,
but not enough both to wash and to drink, he should
rather chuse to wash than to drink, though he die
with thirst. And it was deemed amongst them as great
a sin to eat with unwasht hands, as to commit fornication.
This Tradition of washing hands, though it were
chiefly urged by the <i>Pharisees</i>, yet all the <i>Jews</i> maintained
it, as appeareth by the places quoted.</p>

<p>We may observe three sorts of washing of hands
in use among the <i>Jews</i>. 1. <i>Pharisaical</i> and <i>superstitious</i>,
this was reproved. 2. <i>Ordinary</i>, for outward <i>decency</i>;
this was allowed. The third, in token of <i>innocency</i>;
this was commanded by the <i>Elders</i> of the neighbour-Cities,
in case of murder, <i>Deut. 21. 6.</i> It was practised
by <i>Pilate</i>, <i>Matth. 37. 24.</i> and alluded unto by <i>David</i>,
I will <i>wash my hands in innocency</i>, so will I compass
thine altar, <i>Psal. 26. 6.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>When they came from the Market they washt</i>, <i>Mar.
7. 4.</i> The reason thereof was, because they there having
to do with divers sorts of people, unaware; they
might be polluted. The word used by Saint <i>Mark</i>, is,
βαπτίσωνται, <i>they baptized themselves</i>: implying the
<i>washing of their whole body</i>. And it seemeth that those
<i>Pharisees</i> who were more zealous than others, did
thus <i>wash</i> themselves alwayes before dinner. The
<i>Pharisee</i> marvelled that <i>Christ</i> had not first washed
himself before dinner, <i>Luke 11. 38.</i> Unto this kind of
superstition St. <i>Peter</i> is thought to have inclined, when
he said, <i>Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
and my head</i>, <i>John 13. 9.</i> Thus finding his modesty
disliked, when he refused to have his feet wash’d by
his <i>Lord</i> and <i>Master</i>; now he leapeth into the other
extream, as if he had said, Not <i>my feet only, but my
whole body</i>. Hence proceeded that Sect of the <i>Hemerobaptistæ</i>,
i.e. <i>Daily baptists</i>, so called<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> because they
did <i>every day thus wash themselves</i>.</p>

ornaments, whereof there were<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> two sorts, the
one tied to their <i>Fore-heads</i>, the other to their <i>Left-hands</i>;
hence it followeth, that by these <i>Phylacteries</i>
could not be meant whole garments, or any embosments,
or flourishings woven in the cloth. Generally
they are thought to be schedules or scroles of parchments,
whereof, as I noted, there were two sorts; <i>Phylacteries
for the Fore-head</i>, or <i>Frontlets</i>, reaching from
one Ear to the other, and tied behind with a thong;
and <i>Phylacteries for the hand</i>, fastned upon the Left-arm
above the Elbow on the inside, that it might be near the
heart. Both these sorts were worn, not by the <i>Pharisees</i>
only,<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> but by the <i>Sadduces</i> also, but with
this difference; The <i>Pharisees</i>, haply for greater ostentation,
wore their <i>Hand-Phylacteries above their
Elbows</i>: the <i>Sadduces on the palms of their Hands</i>.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>
Nay, all the <i>Jews</i> wore them, our <i>Saviour Christ</i> not
excepted. The command was general, <i>Exod. 13. 9.</i> It
shall be for a sign unto thee upon thine hand, and for a
memorial between thine eyes. So that it is not the
wearing of them which our <i>Saviour</i> condemned, but
the making of them broad, whereby they would appear
more holy than others.</p>

<p>These four Sections written in scrols of Parchment,
and folded up, they fastned to their <i>fore-heads</i>

they wrote in four distinct pieces of parchment<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> especially,
and if they wrote it in one piece; the
length of every Section ended in one column, and
they did put them into one skin, in which there
was the proportion of four houses or receptacles,
and not into four skins: every receptacle was distinct
by it self; and those that were for the hand, were
written in one piece of Parchment principally, the
four Sections in four columns; but if they wrote
them in four pieces, it was at length, and they put
them in a skin that had but one receptacle.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> In

<p>Touching the name <i>Moses</i> calleth them ‎‏טוטפות‏‎ <i>Totaphot</i>,
which word hath almost as many <i>Etymologies</i>,
as Interpreters; the most probable in my opinion, is,
that they should be so called <i>per Antiphrasin</i>, from ‎‏טטף‏‎
<i>Incedere</i>, <i>to go</i> or <i>move</i>, because they were <i>immoveable</i>:
Hence the <i>Septuagint</i> translate them, ἀσάλευτα
<i>Immoveable ornaments</i>. The Rabbins call them <i>Tephillim</i>,
<i>Prayer ornaments</i>:<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> others call them <i>Pittacia</i>, &amp;
<i>Pittaciola</i>, from πιττάκιον, which signifieth a piece or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
parcel of Cloth. In the Gospel they are called
φυλακτήρια, <i>Phylacteries</i>, from φυλάττω, to <i>conserve</i> or
<i>keep</i>. First, because by the use of them, the <i>Law</i> was
<i>kept</i> and <i>preserved</i> in memory. Secondly, because the
<i>Pharisees</i> superstitiously conceited, that by them, as
by Amulets, Spells, and Charms, hanged about their
necks themselves might be <i>preserved from dangers</i>.
The word φυλακτήριον signifieth a Spell; and
<i>Hierome</i> testifieth, that the <i>Pharisees</i> had a such a conceit
of these ornaments: In which place he compareth
the <i>Pharisees</i> with certain superstitious women
of his time, who carried up and down, upon the like
ground, <i>pervula evangelia, &amp; crucis ligna</i>, short sentences
out of the Gospel, and the reliques of the
Cross. The same superstition hath prevailed with
many of latter times, who for the same purpose
hang the beginning of<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> Saint <i>John</i>’s <i>Gospel</i> about

<p>Thus much of their <i>Phylacteries</i>: In the same verse
is reproved the <i>inlarging of their borders</i>.<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> That
which we read borders in the <i>Gospel</i>, is called, <i>Num.

<i>Deut. 22. 10.</i> which word we likewise translate in
that place, <i>Fringes</i>. They were in the fore-quoted
places commanded, and our <i>Saviour Christ</i> himself
did wear them, <i>Luk. 8. 44.</i> The latter Hebrew word
signifieth a <i>large Fringe</i>, which agravateth the superstition
of the <i>Pharisees</i>, in making their Fringes <i>larger</i>,
when the Law had allowed them <i>large</i>. This literal
exposition I take to be most agreeable with the
<i>Text</i>, though to <i>inlarge</i> in <i>Greek</i> and <i>Latine</i><a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> sometimes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
signifieth to <i>boast, vaunt, or brag of a thing</i>; and
in this sense it may very well fit a <i>Pharisee</i>. The reason
of this command was, to put them in mind of
the Commandments, <i>Numb. 15.</i> And for the furtherance
of this duty,<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> they used sharp thorns in in
their Fringes, that by the often pricking of the Thorn,
whether they walked or sate still, they might be the
more mindful of the Commandments.</p>

ground, and forward or forthright.</p>

<p>The <i>Samaritanes</i> and the <i>Sadduces</i> are of near affinity:
but yet they differ. First<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> The <i>Samaritanes
sacrificed</i> at the Temple built upon Mount <i>Gerizim</i>,
but the <i>Sadduces</i> sacrificed at <i>Jerusalem</i>. Secondly,
The <i>Samaritanes</i> allowed no commerce with the
<i>Jews</i>, <i>John 4. 9.</i> yea, the mutual hatred between the
<i>Samaritans</i> and the <i>Jews</i> was so great, that it was
not lawful for the <i>Jews</i> to eat or drink with the <i>Samaritans</i>.
How is it that thou being a <i>Jew</i>, askest
drink of me which am a woman of <i>Samaria</i>, <i>Joh. 4. 9.</i>
Nay, whereas liberty was granted unto all Nations
of the earth to become <i>Proselites</i> to the <i>Jewes</i>, so did
the <i>Jews</i> hate the <i>Samaritanes</i>, that they would not
suffer a <i>Samaritan</i> to be a <i>Prosylite</i>. This appeareth
by that solemn <i>Excommunication</i>,<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> termed <i>Excommunicatio
in secreto nominis tetragrammati</i>: the form
thereof: as it was applyed (say they) by <i>Ezra</i> and <i>Nehemiah</i>
unto the <i>Samaritanes</i>, was thus, <i>They assembled
the whole Congregation into the Temple of the Lord, and
they brought 300 Priests, <span class="antiqua">and</span> 300 Trumpets, <span class="antiqua">and</span> 300
books of the Law, and as many boys, and they sounded
their Trumpets and the Levites singing cursed the Samaritanes
by all the sorts of Excommunication, in the mystery
of the name <span class="antiqua">Jehovah</span>, and in the Decalogue, &amp; with
the curse of the superiour house of judgement, and likewise
with the curse of the inferiour house of judgement,
that no Israelite should eat the bread of a Samaritane,
(whence they say, he which eateth of a Samaritans bread
is as he who eateth swines flesh) and let no Samaritane be
a Prosylite in Israel, and that they should have no part in
the resurrection of the dead</i>. <i>R. Gersom</i><a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> forbade
the breaking open of the Letters, under the penalty of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
this <i>Excommunication</i>. This proveth what formerly
was said; namely, that between the <i>Jews</i> and the
<i>Samaritanes</i> there was no commerce; but the <i>Sadduces</i>
familiarly conversed with the other <i>Jews</i>, even
with the <i>Pharisees</i> themselves; yea, both sat together
in the same <i>Council</i>, <i>Acts 23. 6.</i> Now the <i>Samaritanes</i>
and <i>Sadduces</i> agree. 1. <i>In the rejection of all the others
traditions.</i> 2. <i>In the rejection of all other Scriptures,

<p>Touching the <i>Samaritanes</i>, there are three degrees
of alteration in their Religion observable. First, the
strange Nations, transplanted by <i>Salmanesar</i> into
<i>Samaria</i>, when <i>Israel</i> was carried away captive into
<i>Assyria</i>, worshipped every one the <i>God of their own
Countries</i>, <i>2 King. 17.</i> Secondly, when they saw they
were devoured by Lyons, because they feared not
the Lord, the <i>King</i> of <i>Assyria</i> sent one of the <i>Priests</i>
which was taken captive, to instruct them in the
true worship of <i>God</i>: which manner of worship
though they received, yet they would not lay aside
their former Idolatry, but made a mixture of Religions,
worshipping the living <i>God</i>, and their own
dumb <i>Idols</i>. Thirdly, <i>Manasses</i>, brother to <i>Jaddus</i> the
<i>High priest</i>, in <i>Jerusalem</i>, being married to <i>Sanballat</i>,
the <i>Horonite</i>’s Daughter, by reason of <i>Nehemiah</i>’s
charge of putting away their strange Wives, being
driven to that exigent, that he must either put away
his Wife, or forgo the hope of the <i>Priest-hood</i>; by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
<i>Sanballat</i>’s means he obtained leave from <i>Alexander</i>
the Great, to build a <i>Temple</i><a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> upon Mount <i>Gariazim</i>,
one of the highest Mountains in <i>Samaria</i>, whither
many other Apostated <i>Jews</i> fled, together with
<i>Manasses</i> being made their <i>High-Priest</i>; and now the
Sect of the <i>Samaritanes</i> (between whom and the
<i>Jews</i> there was such hatred) began, now all those
fore-mentioned errors were maintained: And of
this Hill it is, that the woman of <i>Samaria</i> speaketh
<i>John 4. 20.</i> Our Fathers worshipped in this <i>Mountain</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i></p>

</div>

<p>By comparing the <i>Dogmata</i> of the <i>Pharisees</i>, with
these of the <i>Sadduces</i>, we may perceive a manifest
opposition between them; yet both these joyned
against <i>Christ</i>, <i>Mark 12.</i></p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Essenes.</i></span></h3>

<p>The <i>Etymologies</i> of the names <i>Essæi</i>, or <i>Esseni</i>, i.e.
<i>Essenes</i>, are divers, that which I prefer is
from the <i>Syriake</i> ‎‏אסא‏‎ <i>Asa</i>, signifying θεραπεύειν
to heal, or cure Diseases. Hence<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> are the
men so often termed, θεραπευταὶ and the women
amongst them, θεραπευτρίδες, that is, <i>Physicians</i>. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
though they gave themselves chiefly to the study of
the <i>Bible</i> yet withal they studied <i>Physick</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_148" id="Footnote_148"></a><a href="#FNanchor_148"><span class="label">[148]</span></a> <i>Joseph. de
bello Judaic.
lib. 2. c. 12. p.
786.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Of these <i>Essenes</i> there were two sorts, some <i>Theoricks</i>,
giving themselves wholly to <i>speculation</i>; others
<i>Practicks</i>, laborious and painful in the daily exercise
of those <i>handy-crafts</i>, in which they were most
skilful. Of the latter, <i>Philo</i> treateth in his book entituled,
<i>Quod omnis vir probus</i>: Of the former, in
the book following, entituled, <i>De vita contemplativa</i>.</p>

<p>Their <i>Dogmata</i>, their <i>Ordinance</i>, or <i>Constitutions</i>,
did symbolize in many things with <i>Pythagoras</i> his,
where they do agree. Therefore my purpose is, first
to name <i>Pythagoras</i> his; and then to proceed on with
the <i>Essenes</i>. They follow thus.</p>

<p>The<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> <i>Pythagoreans professed a communion of goods</i>:
<i>So the Essenes</i>.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> <i>they had one common purse or stock</i>,
none richer, none poorer than other; out of this
common treasury, every one supplyed his own
wants without leave, and administred to the necessities
of others: only they might not relieve any of
their kindred without leave from their Overseers.
They did not buy or sell among themselves, but each
supplyed the others want, by a kind of commutative
bartring: yea, liberty was granted to take one
from another what they wanted, without exchange.
They performed Offices of service mutually one to
another; for mastership and service cannot stand
with communion of goods: and servants are commonly
injurious to the state of their Masters, according
to that saying of <i>R. Gamaliel</i>,<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> <i>He that multiplyeth
servants, multiplieth thieves</i>. When they travelled,
besides weapons for defence, they took nothing
with them, for in whatsoever City or Village they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
came, they repaired to the Fraternity of the <i>Essenes</i>,
and were there entertained as members of the same.
And if we do attentively read <i>Josephus</i>, we may observe
that the <i>Essenes</i> of every City joyned themselves
into one <i>common Fraternity</i> or <i>Colledge</i>. Every
Colledge had two sorts of Officers: <i>First</i>, <i>Treasurers</i>,
who looked to the common stock, provided
their diet, appointed each his task, and other publick
necessaries. Secondly, <i>Others, who entertained their
strangers</i>.</p>

<p>9. <i>The Pythagoreans the first five years were not
permitted to speak in the School</i>:<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> but were initiated <i>per
quinquennale silentium</i>,<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> and not until then suffered
to come into the presence of, or sight of <i>Pythagoras</i>.
To this may be referred the <i>Essenes silence at Table</i>
straightly observed, so that <i>Decem simul sedentibus, nemo
loquitur invitis novem</i>; <i>Drusius</i><a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> renders it, that
ten of them sitting together, none of them spake
without leave obtained of the nine. When any did
speak, it was not their custome to interrupt him with
words, but by nods of the head, or beckenings, or
holding their finger, or shaking their heads, and
other such like dumb signs and gestures, to signifie
their doubtings, disliking, or approving the matter
in hand. And to the time of silence amongst the <i>Pythagoreans</i>,
that it must be for five years, may be referred
the initiation of the <i>Essenes</i>; for amongst them
none were presently admitted into their <i>society</i>, with
full liberty, but they under went four years of tryal
and probation. The first year they received <i>Dolabellum,<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
Perizoma, &amp; vestem albam</i>, a <i>spadle</i>,
with which they digged a convenient place to ease
Nature; a <i>pair of breeches</i>, which they used in bathing
or washing themselves; a <i>white garment</i>, which
especially that Sect affected. At this time they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
their commons allowed them, but without, not in
the common dining Hall. The second year they admitted
them to the <i>participation of holy matters</i>, and
instructed them in the use of them. Two years after
they admitted them in <i>full manner</i>, making them of
their <i>Corporation</i>, after they had received an Oath,
truly to observe all the Rules and Ordinances of the
<i>Essenes</i>. If any brake his oath, an hundred of them
being assembled together, expelled him, upon which
expulsion commonly followed death within a short
time; for none having once entred this Order,
might receive alms or any meat from other; and
themselves would feed such a one, only with distastful
herbs, which wasted his body, and brought it very
low: sometimes they would re-admit such a one
being brought near unto death; but commonly they
suffered him to die in that misery.</p>

<p>13. <i>They abstained from marriage</i>, not that they disliked
marriage in it self, or intended an end or period
to procreation: but partly, in wariness of womens
intemperance; partly, because they were perswaded
that no woman would continue faithful to
one man. This avoiding of marriage is not to be understood
generally of all the <i>Essenes</i>, for they disagreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
among themselves in this point. Some were of the
opinion before noted: others married for propagation.
<i>Nihilominus autem cum tanta ipsi moderatione
conveniunt, ut per triennium explorent valetudinem fœminarum;
&amp; si constanti purgatione apparuerint idoneæ
partui, ita eas in matrimonia asciscunt. Nemo tamen cum
prægnante concumbit, ut ostendant, quòd nuptias non voluptatis,
sed liberorum causa inierint.</i> Thus the latter
sort preserved their Sect by the procreation of children:
the former sort preserved it by a kind of adoption
of other mens children, counting them as
near Kinsmen, and tutoring them in the Rules of
Discipline, as <i>Josephus</i> witnesseth. <i>Pliny</i><a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> addeth
also, that many other of the <i>Jews</i>, when they began
to be struck in years, voluntarily joyned themselves
unto them, being moved thereunto, either
because of the variable state and troubles of the
world, or upon consideration of their own former
licentious courses, as if they would by this means
exercise a kind of penance upon themselves.</p>

</div>

<p>Concerning the beginning of this Sect, from
whom, or when it began, it is hard to determine.
Some<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> make them as ancient as the <i>Rechabites</i>, and
the <i>Rechabites</i> to have differed only in the addition
of some rules and ordinances from the <i>Kenites</i>, mentioned
<i>Judg. 1. 16.</i> And thus by consequence the <i>Essenes</i>
were as ancient, as the <i>Israelites</i> departure out
of <i>Egypt</i>: for <i>Jethro</i>, <i>Moses</i> father-in-law, as appeareth
by the Text, was a <i>Kenite</i>: but neither of these
seemeth probable. For the <i>Kenites</i> are not mentioned
in Scripture, as a <i>distinct order</i> or <i>sect of people</i>, but
as a <i>distinct family</i>, <i>kindred</i>, or <i>Nation</i>, <i>Numb. 24. 21.</i>
Secondly, the <i>Rechabites</i>, they neither did build
houses, but dwelt in Tents; neither did they deal in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
husbandry, they sowed no seed, nor planted Vineyards,
nor had any, <i>Jer. 55. 7.</i> The <i>Essenes</i>, on the contrary,
they dwelt not in tents, but in houses;<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> and
they imployed themselves especially in husbandry.
One of the <i>Hebrew Doctors</i><a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> saith, that the <i>Essenes</i>
were <i>Nazarites</i>: but that cannot be, because the
Law enjoyned the <i>Nazarites</i>, when the time of the
Consecration was out, to present themselves at the
door of the <i>Tabernacle</i> or <i>Temple</i>, <i>Num. 6.</i> Now the
<i>Essenes</i> had no access to the <i>Temple</i>. When therefore,
or from what Author this Sect took its beginning,
is uncertain. The first that I find mentioned by the
name of an <i>Essene</i>, was one <i>Judas</i>,<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> who lived in
the time of <i>Aristobulus</i> the Son of <i>Joannes Hyrcanus</i>,
before our <i>Saviours</i> Birth about one hundred years:
Howsoever the Sect was of greater antiquity;<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> for
all three, <i>Pharisees</i>, <i>Sadduces</i>, and <i>Essenes</i>, were in <i>Jonathan</i>’s
time, the brother of <i>Judeas Macchabeus</i>, who
was fifty years before <i>Aristobulus</i>. Certain it is, that
this Sect continued until the daies of our <i>Saviour</i>,
and after; for <i>Philo</i> and <i>Josephus</i> speaks of them as
living in their times. What might be the reason
then, that there is no mention of them in the <i>New
Testament</i>? I answer; First, The number of them
seemeth not to have been great, in <i>Philo</i> and <i>Josephus</i>
his time,<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> about four thousand, which being dispersed
in many Cities, made the Faction weak: and
haply in <i>Jerusalem</i> when our <i>Savior</i> lived, they were
either few or none. Secondly, if we observe histories
we shall find them peaceable and quiet, not opposing
any, and therefore not so liable to reproof as the <i>Pharisees</i>
and <i>Sadduces</i>, who opposed each other, and both
joyned against <i>Christ</i>. Thirdly, why might they not
as well be passed over in silence in the <i>New Testament</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
(especially containing themselves quietly without
contradiction of others) as the <i>Rechabites</i> in the <i>Old
Testament</i>, of whom there is mention only once, and
that obliquely, although their Order continued about
three hundred years before this testimony was
given of them by the Prophet <i>Jeremy</i>; for between
<i>Jehu</i> (with whom <i>Jonadab</i> was Coetanean) and <i>Zedekiah</i>,
Chronologers observe the distance of many
years. Lastly, though the name <i>Essenes</i> be not found
in Scripture,<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> yet we shall find in S. <i>Paul</i>’s Epistles
many things reproved, which were taught in the
School of the <i>Essenes</i>. Of this nature was that advice
given unto <i>Timothy</i>, <i>1 Tim. 5. 23.</i> <i>Drink no longer water,
but use a little wine</i>. Again, <i>1 Tim. 4. 3.</i> <i>Forbidding to
marry, and commanding to abstain from meats is a Doctrine
of Devils</i>; but especially <i>Coloss. 2.</i> in many
passages the <i>Apostle</i> seemeth directly to point at
them, <i>Let no man condemn you in meat and drink</i>, <i>v. 16.</i>
<i>Let no man bear rule over you, by humbleness of mind,
and worshipping of Angels</i>, <i>vers. 18.</i> τί δογματίζεσθε;
<i>Why are ye subject to Ordinances?</i> <i>ver. 20.</i> The <i>Apostle</i>
useth the word δόγματα, which was applyed by the
<i>Essenes</i> to denote their <i>Ordinances</i>, <i>Aphorisms</i>, or
<i>Constitutions</i>. In the verse following he gives an instance
of some particulars, <i>Touch not, taste not, handle
not</i>, <i>vers. 21.</i> Now the Junior company of <i>Essenes</i>
might not <i>touch</i> their Seniors. And in their diet, their
taste was limited to bread, salt, water, and hyssop.
And these ordinances they undertook, διὰ πόθον σοφίας
saith <i>Philo</i>, for the <i>love of wisdom</i>: but the Apostle
concludeth, <i>vers. 23.</i> That these things had only,
λόγον σοφίας, a shew of <i>wisdom</i>. And whereas <i>Philo</i>
termeth the Religion of the <i>Essenes</i>, by the name of
θεραπεία, which word signifieth <i>religious worship</i>, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
<i>Apostle</i> termeth in the same verse, ἐθελοθρησκείαν, <i>Voluntary-religion</i>,
or <i>will-worship</i>: yea, where he termeth
their Doctrine πατρίαν φιλοσοφίαν, a kind of <i>Philosophy</i>
received from their Fore-fathers by Tradition, Saint
<i>Paul</i> biddeth them beware of <i>Philosophy</i>, <i>vers. 8.</i></p>

<p>We formerly observed two sorts of <i>Essenes</i>; <i>Practicks</i>
and <i>Theoricks</i>: both agreed in their <i>Aphorisms</i>,
or <i>Ordinances</i>; but in certain circumstances they
differed.</p>

<p>1. The <i>Practicks</i> dwelt in the Cities; The <i>Theoricks</i>
shunned the Cities, and dwelt in Gardens, and
solitary Villages.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Practicks</i> spent the day in manual Crafts,
keeping of Sheep, looking to Bees, tilling of Ground,
<i>&amp;c.</i> they were τεχνίται, <i>Artificers</i>. The <i>Theoricks</i>
spent the day in meditation, and prayers, whence
they were by a kind of excellency, by <i>Philo</i> termed,
ἱκέται, <i>Supplicantes</i>.</p>

<p>3. The <i>Practicks</i> had every day their dinner and supper
allowed them; the <i>Theoricks</i> only their supper.</p>

<p>The <i>Practicks</i> had for their Commons every one
his dish of Water-gruel, and bread; The <i>Theoricks</i>
only bread, and salt: if any were of a more delicate
palate then other, to him it was permitted to eat
Hyssop; their drink for both, was common water.</p>

<p>Some are of Opinion, that these <i>Theoricks</i> were
<i>Christian Monks</i>; but the countary appeareth, for
these reasons:</p>

<p>1. In that whole Book of <i>Philo</i>, concerning the
<i>Theoricks</i>, there is no mention either of <i>Christ</i>, or
<i>Christians</i>, of the <i>Evangelists</i>, or <i>Apostles</i>.</p>

<p>2. The <i>Theoricks</i>, in that Book of <i>Philo</i>’s, are not
any new Sect of late beginning, as the <i>Christians</i> at
that time were, as is clearly evidenced by <i>Philo</i> his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
own words. First, In calling the Doctrine of the <i>Essenes</i>
πατρίαν φιλοσοφίαν, <i>A philosophy derived unto them
by tradition from their fore-fathers</i>. Secondly, in saying,
<i>Habent priscorum commentarios, qui hujus sectæ
autores</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. The inscription of that Book, is not only περὶ βίου
θεωρητικοῦ but also περὶ ἱκετῶν. Now <i>Philo</i><a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> elsewhere
calleth the whole Nation of the <i>Jews</i>, τὸ ἱκετικὸν γένος,
which argueth, that those <i>Theoricks</i> were <i>Jews</i>, not
<i>Christians</i>.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Gaulonitæ, and the Herodians.</i></span></h3>

<p>Other Factions there were among the <i>Jews</i>, which
are improperly termed Sects. Of these there
were principally two. First, <i>Gaulonitæ</i>. Secondly, <i>Herodiani</i>.
The <i>Gaulonitæ</i> had their names from one <i>Judas</i>,
who sometimes<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> was called <i>Judas Gaulonites</i>,
sometimes<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> <i>Judas Galilæus</i>, of whom <i>Gamaliel</i> speaketh,
<i>Acts 5. 37.</i> <i>After this man rose up Judas of Galilee
in the daies of the tribute.</i> The tribute here spoken of,
was that made by <i>Cyrenius</i>, sometimes called <i>Quirinius</i>:
the name in <i>Greek</i> is one and the same, but differently
read by Expositors. This <i>Cyrenius</i> was sent
from <i>Rome</i> by <i>Augustus</i>, into <i>Syria</i>, and from thence
came into <i>Judæa</i>, where <i>Coponius</i> was <i>President</i>, and
there he raised this Tax; which taxation is unadvisedly
by some confounded with that mentioned,
<i>Luke 2. 1.</i> Both were raised under <i>Augustus</i>, but they
differed. First, this was only of <i>Syria</i> and <i>Judæa</i>; that
in Saint <i>Luke</i> was universal, of the whole world. Secondly,
this was, when <i>Archelaus</i>, <i>Herods</i> son, was
banished into <i>Vienna</i>, having reigned nine years;
that, under <i>Herod</i> the Great: Whence there is an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
observable Emphasis, in that Saint <i>Luke</i> saith, it was
the <i>first</i> taxing, having reference unto this <i>second</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>The occasion<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> of this Faction was thus: When
<i>Cyrenius</i> levied this Tax, and seized upon <i>Archelaus</i>,
<i>Herod</i>’s sons goods; then arose this <i>Judas</i> opposing
this Tribute; and telling the people, that Tribute
was a manifest token of servitude, and that they
ought to call none <i>Lord</i>, but only him who was
<i>Lord of Lords</i>, the God of heaven and earth. Whence
those that adhered unto him were called <i>Gaulonitæ</i>;
they were also called <i>Galileans</i>.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> It was their blood
that <i>Pilate</i> mixed with their sacrifices, <i>Luk. 13. 1.</i> For
<i>Pilate</i> had not authority over the Nation of the <i>Galileans</i>.
The reason of this mixture is thought<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> to
be, because the <i>Galileans</i> forbad sacrifices to be offered
for the <i>Roman Empire</i>, or for the safety of the
<i>Emperour</i>; whereupon, <i>Pilate</i> being incensed with
anger, slew them whilst they were sacrificing.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> To
this faction belonged those murderers, termed Σικαριοὶ,
mentioned, <i>Acts 21. 18.</i></p>

<p>Concerning the <i>Herodians</i>, those that number them
among <i>Hereticks</i>, make the heresie to consist in two
things: First, in that they took <i>Herod</i> the Great for
the promised <i>Messias</i>; because in his Reign, he being
a stranger, the <i>Scepter</i> was departed from <i>Judah</i>;
which was the promised time of the <i>Messiah</i> his coming.
Secondly, they honoured him with superstitious
solemnities annually performed upon his Birth-days.
Of <i>Herod</i> his Birth-day the <i>Poet</i> speaketh,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><i>&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; Cum</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Herodis venere dies, unctaque fenestra,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Dispositæ pinguem nebulam vomuere lucernæ,</i></div>
<div class="verse"><i>Portantes violas, rubrumque amplexa catinum,</i></div>

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Now whether this latter may be referred to <i>Herod</i>
the Great, I much doubt; because I find not any Author
among the Ancients to speak of <i>Herod</i> the Great
his Birth-day: It was another <i>Herod</i>, <i>Tetrarch of Galilee</i>,
otherwise called <i>Antipas</i>, whose Birth-day we
read celebrated, <i>Mark 6. 21.</i> The former point, that
the <i>Herodians</i> received <i>Herod</i> as their <i>Messiah</i>, though
it hath many grave Authors<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> avouching it, yet
others<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> justly question the truth thereof; for if the
<i>Herodians</i> were <i>Jews</i> (as most think) how then could
they imagine, that <i>Herod</i>, a stranger, could be the
<i>Messiah</i>, seeing that it was so commonly preached by
the <i>Prophets</i>, and known unto the People, that the
<i>Messiah</i>, must be a <i>Jew</i> born, of the Tribe of <i>Judah</i>,
and of the house of <i>David</i>?</p>

<p>Others say,<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> that the <i>Herodians</i> were certain flatterers
in <i>Herod</i> his Court, varying and changing many

<p>To omit many other conjectures utterly improbable,
I incline to Saint <i>Hierom</i>, whose Opinion is,<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a>
that the <i>Herodians</i> were those who stood stifly for tribute
to be paid to <i>Cæsar</i>. It concerned <i>Herod</i>, who
at first received his Crown from <i>Cæsar</i>, to further
<i>Cæsar</i>’s tribute, not only in way of thankfulness, but
also in way of policy, to prevent a possible deposing
or desceptring; for it was in <i>Cæsar</i>’s power to take
away the Crown again when pleased him. Now, in
respect that <i>Herod</i> saught to kill <i>Christ</i>, and the <i>Herodians</i>
with the <i>Pharisees</i> took counsel against him; unto
this our <i>Saviour</i> might have reference, saying,
<i>Mar. 8. 15.</i> <i>Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and
of the leaven of <span class="antiqua">Herod</span>.</i> Viz. <i>Of their contagious Doctrine,
and fox-like subtleties.</i></p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Their Temple.</i></span></h3>

<p>When the <i>Israelites</i> came out of <i>Ægypt</i>,
<i>Moses</i> was commanded to build
a <i>Tabernacle</i> for the place of <i>Gods</i>
publick worship. Afterward, when they were settled
in the promised Land, then <i>Solomon</i> was commanded
to build a <i>Temple</i>.</p>

<p>These two shadowed the difference between the
<i>Jews Synagogue</i>, and the <i>Christian Church</i>. The <i>Tabernacle</i>
was moveable, and but for a time: The <i>Temple</i>
fixed, and permanent: the state of the <i>Jews</i> vanishing,
to continue in their generations; the state of
<i>Christians</i> durable, to continue unto the worlds end.
More principally it shadowed forth the state of the
<i>Church Militant</i> here on earth, and <i>triumphant</i> in heaven:
Unto both the <i>Prophet David</i> alludeth; <i>Lord,
Who shall sojourn in thy Tabernacle? who shall rest in
thine holy Mountain?</i> <i>Psal. 15. 1.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>There were in the same tract of ground three hills,
<i>Sion</i>, <i>Moria</i>, and Mount <i>Calvary</i>. On <i>Sion</i> was the
City and Castle of <i>David</i>; on <i>Moria</i> was the <i>Temple</i>,
and on Mount <i>Calvary</i> <i>Christ</i> was crucified. But<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
all these three were generally called by the name of
<i>Sion</i>; whence it is, that though the <i>Temple</i> were built
on <i>Moria</i>, yet the Scripture speaketh of it commonly,
as if it were upon Mount <i>Sion</i>.</p>

<p>In their <i>Temple</i> there are these three things considerable:
First, the <i>Sanctum Sanctorum</i>, the <i>Holy of Holies</i>;
answerable to our <i>Quire</i> in the <i>Cathedral Churches</i>.
Secondly, the <i>Sanctum</i>, the <i>Sanctuary</i>; answerable to
the <i>Body</i> of the <i>Church</i>. Thirdly, the <i>Atrium</i>, the
<i>Court</i>; answerable to the <i>Church-yard</i>.</p>

<p>In the <i>Holy of Holies</i> there were the Golden Censer,
and the <i>Ark</i> of the <i>Testament</i>, <i>Heb. 9. 4.</i></p>

<p>In<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> the <i>Ark</i> there were three things: First, the
<i>pot of Manna</i>; secondly, <i>Aaron</i>’s <i>rod that budded</i>;
thirdly, the <i>Tables of the Testament</i>, <i>Heb. 9. 4.</i> Thus
they were in <i>Moses</i> his time; but afterwards in the
days of <i>Solomon</i>, onely the Tables of the Law were
found in the <i>Ark</i>, <i>1 King. 8. 9.</i></p>

<p>The cover of this <i>Ark</i> was called ἱλαστήριον, the <i>Propitiatory</i>,
or <i>Mercy-seat</i>, because it <i>covered</i> and hid the
Law, that it appeared not before God to plead against
man. It was a type of <i>Christ</i>, who likewise is
termed ἱλαστήριον, our <i>Propitiation</i>, <i>Rom. 3. 25.</i> and ἵλασμος,
<i>a Propitiatory</i>, <i>John 2. 2.</i> At each end of the <i>Mercy-seat</i>
stood a golden <i>Cherub</i>, each <i>Cherub</i> stretched
forth his wings; and from between them, as from an
<i>Oracle</i>, God gave his answer, <i>Exod. 25. 22.</i> Hence
it is, that the <i>Lord</i> is said to sit between the <i>Cherubims</i>,
<i>Ps. 99. 1.</i> The positure of the <i>Cherubims</i> was such,
that their faces were each towards the other, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
both looking down towards the <i>Mercy-seat</i>; they
fitly shadowed out the people of the <i>Jews</i> and <i>Christians</i>,
both looking toward each other, but both expecting
salvation in <i>Christ</i> only.</p>

<p>In the <i>Sanctuary</i>, there was the <i>Incense-altar</i> in the
middle, and the Table, with the twelve Loaves of
Shew-bread on it on the one side, and the Candlestick
on the other. The incense-altar was a type of our
prayers, <i>Psal. 141. 2.</i> And that this altar must be once
every year sprinkled with the blood of the Sacrifice by
the <i>High-priest</i>, <i>Exod. 30. 10.</i> It teacheth that our very
prayers, except they be purified by the blood of <i>Christ</i>
they are unavailable before <i>God</i>. The twelve loaves
were a type of the twelve <i>Tribes</i>, and the Candlestick
a type of the Word of God. In them all, we
may see the necessity of both Ordinances required,
<i>Prayer</i> and <i>Preaching</i>, if we would be presented acceptable
unto the <i>Lord</i>: The <i>Candlestick</i> was a type
of <i>Preaching</i>; <i>Incense</i>, of <i>Prayer</i>.</p>

<p>In <i>Moses</i> his <i>Tabernacle</i> there was but one <i>Table</i>,
and one <i>Candlestick</i>: In <i>Solomon</i>’s <i>Temple</i> there were
ten <i>Tables</i>, and ten <i>Candlesticks</i>; as likewise in the
<i>Court</i> of the <i>Tabernacle</i>, there was but one brazen
Laver, in the <i>Court</i> of the <i>Temple</i> there were ten, and
another great Vessel wherein the <i>Priests</i> washed: in
the <i>Tabernacle</i> there were but <i>two silver Trumpets</i>; in
the <i>Temple</i> there were an <i>hundred and twenty Priests
sounding Trumpets</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Courts</i> of the <i>Temple</i> at the first were but two,
<i>Atrium Sacerdotum</i>, the <i>Priests Court</i>; and <i>Atrium
populi</i>, the <i>Peoples Court</i>.</p>

<p>In the <i>Priests Court</i> were the brazen Altar for Sacrifices,
and the Laver for the washing, both of the
<i>Priests</i> and the <i>Sacrifices</i>. The <i>Laver</i>, and the <i>Altar</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
scituated in the same Court, signified the same as the
<i>water</i> and <i>blood</i> issued out of <i>Christ</i>’s side; namely, the
necessary concurrence of these two Graces in all that
shall be saved, <i>sanctification</i>, <i>justification</i>; <i>sanctification</i>
intimated by the <i>Laver</i> and <i>blood</i>: <i>justification</i>
by the <i>Altar</i> and <i>blood</i>.</p>

<p>The Court for the <i>Priests</i>, and the Court for the
<i>people</i> were separated<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> each from other; by a wall
of three Cubits high.</p>

</div>

<p>The Court for the <i>people</i> was sometimes called the
<i>outward Court</i>, sometimes the <i>Temple</i>, sometimes <i>Solomon</i>’s
<i>Porch</i>, because it was built about with Porches,
into which the people retired in rainy weather:
It had <i>Solomon</i>’s name, either to continue his
memory, or because the Porches had some resemblance
of that Porch which <i>Solomon</i> built before the
<i>Temple</i>, <i>1 King. 6. 3.</i> <i>Jesus walked in the Temple, in <span class="antiqua">Solomon</span>’s
Porch</i>, <i>John 10. 23.</i> <i>All the people ran unto the
Porch which was called <span class="antiqua">Solomon</span>’s</i>, <i>Acts 3. 11.</i> That is,
this <i>outward Court</i>.</p>

<p>In the midst of the <i>peoples Court</i>, <i>Solomon</i> made a
brazen Scaffold for the <i>King</i>, <i>2 Chron. 6. 13.</i></p>

<p>This <i>Court of the people</i> went round about the <i>Temple</i>,
and though it was one entire Court in the days
of <i>Solomon</i>, yet afterward it was divided by a low
wall, so that the men stood in the inward part of it,
and the women in the outward. This division is
thought to have been made in <i>Jehosaphat</i>’s time, of
whom we read, that he stood in the House of the
<i>Lord</i>, before the <i>new Court</i>, <i>2 Chron. 20. 5.</i> that is, before
the <i>Womens Court</i>.</p>

<p>There was an ascent of fifteen steps or stairs between
the <i>womens Court</i> and the <i>mens</i>,<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> upon these
steps the <i>Levites</i> sung those fifteen Psalms immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
following the one hundredth nineteenth, upon
each step one Psalm, whence those Psalms are entituled,
<i>Psalmi graduales</i>, <i>Songs of degrees</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>In the <i>Womens Court</i> stood their <i>Treasuries</i>, or <i>Alms-box</i>,
as appeareth by the poor Widows casting her
two Mites into it, <i>Luk. 21. 1.</i> In <i>Hebrew</i> it is termed ‎‏קרבן‏‎
<i>Korban</i>, the <i>Chest of Oblation</i>; the word signifieth
barely, an <i>Oblation</i>, or <i>Offering</i>, and accordingly
S. <i>Luk. 21. 4.</i> saith, they all of their superfluities cast
<i>into the offerings</i>; that is into, the <i>Korban</i>, or <i>Chest
of offerings</i>. In Greek it is termed γαζοφυλακεῖον
whence cometh the Latine word, <i>Gazophylacium</i>, a
<i>Treasury</i>. That set up by <i>Jehoiada</i>, <i>2 King. 12. 19.</i> seemeth
to have been different from this, and to have
been extraordinary, only for the repairing of the
<i>Temple</i>; for that stood beside the <i>Altar</i> in the <i>Priests
Court</i>; and the <i>Priests</i>, not the parties that brought
the gifts, put it into the <i>Chest</i>. Sometimes the whole
<i>Court</i> was termed <i>Gazophylacium</i>, a <i>Treasury</i>. These
words speak <i>Jesus</i> in the <i>Treasury</i>, <i>John 8. 20.</i> It is
worth our noting, that the <i>Hebrew</i> word ‎‏צדקה‏‎ <i>Tsedaka</i>,
signifying <i>Alms</i>, signifieth properly <i>Justice</i>; and
thereby is intimated, that the matter of our alms
should be goods justly gotten: And to this purpose
they called their <i>Alms-box</i> ‎‏קופה של צדקה‏‎ <i>Kupha-Sehel-Tsedaka</i>,
the <i>Chest of Justice</i>; and upon their <i>Alms-box</i>
they wrote<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> this abreviature ‎‏מביא‏‎, <i>A gift in

<p><i>Herod</i>’s <i>Temple</i> was finished in eight years.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> It is
greatly questioned among <i>Divines</i>, of which <i>Temple</i>
that speech of the <i>Jews</i> is to be understood, <i>John 2.
20.</i> <i>Forty and six years was this Temple in building</i>.
Many interpret it of the second <i>Temple</i>, saying, that
<i>Herod</i> did only repair that, not build a new: but these
disagree among themselves in the computation; and
the Scripture speaketh peremptorily, that the house
was finished in the sixth year of the Reign of King
<i>Darius</i>, <i>Ezra 6. 15.</i> and <i>Josephus</i> speaketh of <i>Herod</i>’s
<i>building a new Temple, plucking down the old</i>.<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> It
seemeth therefore more probable, that the speech is
to be understood of <i>Herod</i>’s <i>Temple</i>, which, though it
were but eight years in building, yet, at that time,
when this speech was used, it had stood precisely <i>forty
six years</i>,<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> for so many years there are precisely
between the eighteenth year of <i>Herod</i>’s Reign, (at
which time the <i>Temple</i> begun to be built) and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
year of <i>Christ his baptisme</i>, when it is thought that
this was spoken; all which time the <i>Temple</i> was more
and more adorned, beautified, and perfected, in
which respect it may be said to be so long building.</p>

<p>The ancient men are said to weep, when they beheld
the second, because the glory thereof was far
short of <i>Solomon</i>’s, <i>Ez. 3. 12.</i> It was inferiour to <i>Solomon</i>’s
<i>Temple</i>: First, in respect of the building, because
it was lower and meaner.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Secondly, in respect of
the Vessels, being now of brass, which before were
of pure gold. Thirdly, in respect of five things, lost
and wanting in the second <i>Temple</i>, all which were in
the first. First, there was wanting the <i>Ark of God</i>.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
Secondly, <i>Urim and Thummim</i>; <i>God</i> gave no answer
by these two, as in former times. Thirdly, <i>Fire</i>, which
in the second <i>Temple</i> never descended from heaven to
consume their burnt offerings, as it did in the first.
Fourthly, the <i>Glory of God</i> appearing between the
<i>Cherubims</i>, this they termed ‎‏שכינה‏‎ <i>Schecina</i>, the <i>habitation</i>,
or <i>dwelling of God</i>, and hereunto the <i>Apostle</i>
alludeth, <i>In him dwelleth the Fulness of the Godhead
bodily</i>, <i>Coloss. 2. 9.</i> <i>Bodily</i>; that is, not in Clouds
and Ceremonies, as between the <i>Cherubims</i>, but <i>essentially</i>.
Lastly, the <i>Holy Ghost</i>; namely, enabling
them for the gift of <i>Prophecy</i>; for between <i>Malachy</i>
and <i>John the Baptist</i>, there stood up no <i>Prophet</i>, but
only they were instructed <i>per filiam vocis</i>, which they
termed ‎‏בת קול‏‎ <i>Bath Kol</i>, an <i>Eccho from heaven</i>; and
this was the reason why those Disciples, <i>Act. 19. 2.</i>
said, <i>We have not so much as heard whether there be an
Holy Ghost</i>.</p>

<p>Here it may be demanded, How that of the <i>Prophet

than <i>Solomon</i>’s, and it was of greater glory, because
of <i>Christ</i> his Preaching in it.</p>

<p><i>Herod</i>’s <i>Temple</i> was afterwards so set on fire by <i>Titus</i>

of which two Miracles evidently sheweth,
that the time was then come, that God would put
an end both to <i>Jewish Ceremonies</i>, and <i>Heathenish Idolatry</i>;
that the Kingdom of his son might be the better
established.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Their Synagogues, Schools, and Houses
of Prayer.</i></span></h3>

<p>The word <i>Synagogue</i> is from the Greek, συνάγω
to <i>gather-together</i>; and it is applyed to all things
whereof there may be a <i>collection</i>, as συναγωγὴ γάλακτος,
<i>copia lactis</i>, συναγωγὴ πολέμοιο; <i>collectio quæ sunt ad
bellum necessaria</i>. God standeth in <i>Synagoga Deorum</i>,
<i>the Assembly of Judges</i>: but <i>Synagogues</i> are commonly
taken for houses dedicated to the worship of God,
wherein it was lawful to <i>pray</i>, <i>preach</i>, and <i>dispute</i>,
but <i>not to sacrifice</i>. In <i>Hebrew</i> it was called, ‎‏בית הכנסת‏‎
<i>Beth Hacneseth</i>, the <i>House of Assembly</i>. The <i>Temple
at Jerusalem</i> was the <i>Cathedral Church</i>; the <i>Synagogues</i>,
as petty <i>Parish Churches</i> belonging thereunto.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Concerning the time when <i>Synagogues</i> began, it is
hard to determine. It is probable that they began
when the Tribes were settled in the promised Land.
The <i>Temple</i> being then too far distant from those
which dwelt in remote places, it is likely that they
repaired unto certain <i>Synagogues</i> instead of the <i>Temple</i>.
That they were in <i>David</i>’s time appeareth; <i>They have
burnt all the Synagogues of God in the land</i>, <i>Psal. 74. 8.</i>
And <i>Moses</i> of old time had in every City, them that
preached him, being read in the <i>Synagogues</i> every Sabbath
day, <i>Act. 15. 21.</i></p>

<p>In <i>Jerusalem</i> there were<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> four hundred eighty
<i>Synagogues</i>, besides the <i>Temple</i>; partly for <i>Jews</i>, partly
for <i>strangers</i>: one for strangers was called the <i>Synagogue
of the Libertines</i>, <i>Act. 6. 9.</i> Whence it had that
name, whether from the <i>Roman Libertines</i>, such as
had served for their freedom, being opposite to the
<i>Ingenui</i>, those that were free-born; (for many of those
<i>Libertines</i> became <i>Proselites</i>, and had their <i>Synagogues</i><a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>)
or whether it were from <i>Lubar</i>,<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> signifying
an <i>high-place</i>; (for as their <i>Temple</i>, so their <i>Synagogues</i>
and <i>Schools</i> were built on <i>hills</i> and <i>high-places</i>)
because it is said, <i>Prov. 1. 21.</i> <i>Wisdome calleth in high-places</i>:
I leave to the judgment of the Reader.</p>

<p>As the <i>Courts</i> of the people before the <i>Temple</i> were
distinguished by a wall into two rooms, the one for
men, the other for women: so in the <i>Synagogues</i>, the
women were separated from the men,<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> by a partition

<p>In the <i>Synagogues</i> the Scribes ordinarily taught,
but not only they, for <i>Christ</i> himself taught in them,
<i>&amp;c.</i> He that gave liberty to preach there, was termed
ἀρχισυναγώγος. <i>The Ruler of the Synagogue.</i> There was
also a <i>Minister</i> who gave the book unto the <i>Preacher</i>,
and received it again, after the Text had been read.
<i>Christ closed the book, and gave it again unto the Minister</i>,
<i>Luke 4. 20.</i> This is probably he, whom they
called ‎‏שליח צבור‏‎ <i>Sheliach Tsibbur</i>, the <i>Minister</i> or <i>Clerk</i>
of the <i>Synagogue</i>.</p>

<p>Their <i>Schools</i> were different from their <i>Synagogues</i>.
<i>Paul</i> having disputed for the space of three months
in the <i>Synagogue</i>, because divers believed not, but
spake evil of that way, he departed from them, and
separated his Disciples, disputing daily in the <i>School</i>
of one <i>Tyrannus</i>; <i>Act. 19. 8, 9, 10.</i></p>

<p>Their School sometimes is called ‎‏בית‏‎ <i>Beth</i>, an
<i>house</i>, simply, as appeareth by that saying;<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> <i>Octodecim

Those 18 matters controverted between the <i>house</i> of
<i>Sammai</i>, and the <i>house</i> of <i>Hillel</i>, <i>Elias</i> himself could
not decide; that is, between their two <i>Schools</i>. Sometime
it is called ‎‏בית המדרש‏‎ <i>Beth Hammidrasch</i>, an
house of subtle and acute exposition. Here points<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
were more exactly and punctually discussed, than in

<p>Whether their <i>Oratories</i> or places of prayer called
<i>Proseuchæ</i>, were different places from their <i>Schools</i>, or
<i>Synagogues</i>, I have not yet learned. That some of
these were without the City, that proveth nothing,
for so might <i>Synagogues</i> and <i>Schools</i> too. <i>Epiphanius</i>
treateth of those <i>Oratories</i>,<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> but there he speaketh

prayer</i>, mention is made, <i>Acts 16. 13.</i> in which S. <i>Paul</i>
sate down and spake unto the woman: which gesture
intimateth rather preaching than praying: true, all
gesture was in use for prayer; standing, kneeling, sitting:
<i>Abraham stood before the Lord</i>, <i>Gen. 18. 22.</i> that is,
<i>he prayed</i>. <i>The Publican stood afar off and prayed</i>, <i>Luke
18. 13.</i> Whence by way of Proverb they say,<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> <i>Sine

to the <i>Lord</i>, implieth <i>preaching</i>, not <i>prayer</i>. It is probable,
that as at the gate of the <i>Temple</i>, so at the gate
of these <i>Oratories</i>, the poorer sort of people assembled
to expect alms: Whence some use the word<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>

<p>The gates of the whole circuit of the<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> wall about
<i>Jerusalem</i> were nine: The <i>Sheep-gate</i>, <i>Neh.

Gates, and likewise the <i>Horse gate</i>, <i>Nehem. 3. 28.</i>
were so called, because they were in manner of
three several <i>Market places</i>, and at the one Gate,
<i>Sheep</i>, at the other, <i>Fish</i>, and at the third, <i>Horses</i> were
sold. The <i>Old gate</i> was so called, because it was supposed
to have remained from the time of the <i>Jebusites</i>,
and not to have been destroyed by the <i>Assyrians</i>;
it was near <i>Calvary</i>, and without this Gate
<i>Christ</i> was crucified. Concerning the other Gates little
is spoken.</p>

<p>Touching the Gates of the <i>Temple</i>, there were<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
two of principal note, both built by <i>Solomon</i>, the
one for those that were new married, the other for
mourners and excommunicate persons. The mourners
were distinguished from the excommunicate
persons, by having their lips covered with a skirt of
their garment; none entered that gate with their lip
uncovered, but such as were excommunicate. Now
the <i>Israelites</i> which one the <i>Sabbath</i> days sate between
those Gates said unto the <i>new married</i>: <i>He, whose
Name dwelleth in this house, glad thee with children</i>.
Unto the mourner, <i>He, which dwelleth in this house,
glad and comfort thee</i>. Unto the excommunicate, <i>He,

<p>Among the <i>Jews</i>, the gates were places of chiefest

<span class="smaller"><i>Of their Groves, and high Places.</i></span></h3>

<p>The ancient <i>Heathens</i> did not only not build
<i>Temples</i>,<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> but they held it utterly unlawful
so to do. The reason of this might be, because they
thought no <i>Temple</i> spacious enough for the <i>Sun</i>,
which was their chief God. Hence came that saying,<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
<i>Mundus universus est Templum Solis</i>; <i>The
whole world is a Temple for the Sun</i>. Moreover, they
thought it unfit to straiten, and confine the supposed
Infiniteness of their fancied <i>Deities</i> within walls; and
therefore when after-times had brought in the use
of <i>Temples</i>, yet their <i>God Terminus</i>, and divers others
of their <i>Gods</i> were worshipped in <i>Temples</i> open
roofed, which were therefore called ὕπαιθρα. This I
take to be the reason why they made choice of <i>Hills</i>
and <i>Mountains</i>, as the convenientest places for their
Idols. These <i>consecrated Hills</i>, are those <i>high places</i>
which the <i>Scripture</i> so often forbids. Afterwards,
as the number of their <i>Gods</i> encreased; so
the number of their <i>consecrated hills</i> was multiplied,
from which their <i>Gods</i> and <i>Goddesses</i> took their
names; as <i>Mercurius Cyllenius</i>, <i>Venus Erycina</i>, <i>Jupiter
Capitolinus</i>. At length to beautifie these <i>holy hills</i>, the
places of their idolatrous worship they beset them
with trees, and hence came the <i>consecration of Groves,
and Woods</i>, from which their Idols many times were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
named.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> At last some choice and select Trees began
to be <i>consecrated</i>.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Those <i>French Magi</i>, termed
<i>Dryadæ</i>, worshipped the <i>Oak</i>, in <i>Greek</i> termed Δρῦς,
and thence had their names. The <i>Etrurians</i> worshipped
an <i>Holm-tree</i>; and<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> amongst the <i>Celtæ</i>, a <i>tall

<p>Among the <i>Israelites</i>, the Idolatry began under the
Judges, <i>Othniel</i> and <i>Ehud</i>, <i>Judg. 3. 7.</i> and at the last it
became so common in <i>Israel</i>, that they had peculiar
<i>Priests</i>, whom they termed <i>Prophets of the Grove</i>,
<i>1 King. 18. 19.</i> and <i>Idols</i> of the <i>Grove</i>; that is, <i>peculiar
Idols</i>, unto whom their <i>Groves</i> were <i>consecrated</i>,
<i>2 King. 21. 7.</i> <i>2 Chron. 15. 16.</i> As Christians in the consecration
of their <i>Churches</i>, make special choice of
some peculiar Saints, by whose name they call them,
as Saint <i>Peter’s Church</i>, S. <i>Paul</i>’s, S. <i>Andrews</i>, &amp;c.
So they consecrated their <i>Groves</i> unto particular <i>Idols</i>;
whence in prophane Authors we read of <i>Diana Nemorensis</i>,
<i>Diana Arduenna</i>, <i>Albunea Dea</i>; all receiving
their names from the <i>Groves</i> in which they were
worshipped: yea, the <i>Idol</i> it self is sometimes called
by the name of a <i>Grove</i>: <i><span class="antiqua">Josiah</span> brought out the Grove
from the House of the Lord</i>, <i>2 King. 23. 6.</i> It is probable,
that in this Idol was pourtraited the form
and similitude of a <i>Grove</i>, and thence it was called a
<i>Grove</i>, as those silver similitudes of <i>Diana</i>’s <i>Temple</i>
made by <i>Demetrius</i>, were termed <i>Temples of Diana</i>,
<i>Acts 19. 24.</i></p>

<span class="smaller"><i>The Cities of Refuge.</i></span></h3>

<p>These places of <i>Refuge</i>, appointed by God, differed
from those of <i>Hercules</i>, and <i>Romulus</i>, and
other <i>Heathens</i>; because God allowed safety only
to those, who were guiltless in respect of their intention:
but the others were common Sanctuaries,
as well for the guilty as the guiltless. If any man
did fortuitously or by chance kill another man, in
such a case liberty was granted unto the offender
to fly; at first, unto the <i>Altar</i> for refuge, as is implied
by that text of Scripture, <i>If any man come presumptuously
unto his Neighbour, to slay him with guile,
thou shalt take him from mine Altar</i>, <i>Exod. 21. 14.</i>
Yea, we may conjecture this custome of refuge to
have continued in force always, by the practice of
<i>Joab</i>, <i>1 King. 2. 28.</i> Notwithstanding, lest the Altar
might be too far distant from the place where the
fact might be committed, it is probable that therefore
God ordained certain <i>Asyla</i>, or <i>Cities of Refuge</i>,
which for the same reason are thought to have been<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
equally distant one from the other in <i>Canaan</i>:
The Cities were in number six; <i>Bezer</i> of the <i>Reubenites</i>
Country, <i>Ramoth</i> of <i>Gilead</i>, in the <i>Gadites</i>, and
<i>Golan</i> in <i>Bashan</i>, of the <i>Manassites</i>: these three <i>Moses</i>
separated beyond <i>Jordan</i>, <i>Deut. 4. 41, 43.</i> The other
three, appointed by <i>Joshua</i> in the Land of <i>Canaan</i>,
were <i>Cadesh</i> in <i>Galilee</i> in Mount <i>Naphthali</i>; <i>Schechem</i>
in <i>Ephraim</i>, and <i>Kiratharba</i> (which is <i>Hebron</i>) in the
Mountain of <i>Judah</i>, <i>Josh. 20. 7.</i> There are other Cities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of like nature: <i>God</i> promised the <i>Israelites</i>, upon condition
of their obedience, after their Coasts were inlarged;
but it seemeth that disobedience hindred the
accomplishment thereof, for the Scripture mentioneth
not the fulfilling of it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_232" id="Footnote_232"></a><a href="#FNanchor_232"><span class="label">[232]</span></a> <i>Rab. Salom.

</div>

<p>Concerning these Cities, the <i>Hebrews</i> note from
these words, <i>Thou shalt prepare the way</i>, <i>Deut. 9. 3.</i>
That the <i>Senate</i>, or <i>Magistrate</i> in <i>Israel</i>, were bound
to prepare the ways to the <i>Cities of Refuge</i>, and<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> to
make them fit, and broad, and to remove out of
them all stumbling-blocks and obstacles: and they
suffered not any Hill or Dale to be in the way, nor
water-streams, but they made a Bridge over it, that
nothing might hinder him that fled thither. And the
breadth of the way to the <i>Cities of Refuge</i>, was not
less than two and thirty Cubits, and at the partitions
of the ways, they set up in writing, <i>Refuge, Refuge</i>:
that the man-slayer might know and turn thitherward.
On the fifteenth of the moneth <i>Adar</i>, or
<i>February</i>, every year the <i>Magistrates</i> sent messengers
to prepare the ways.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_233" id="Footnote_233"></a><a href="#FNanchor_233"><span class="label">[233]</span></a> <i>Maimon. in
Rotsach. cap. 8.
sect. 5.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Furthermore it was provided, that two or three
wise men should be imployed, to perswade the <i>Avenger
of blood</i>, if haply he did pursue the man-slayer
on the way, that he should offer no violence, until
the Cause were heard and examined. The manner
of examination was thus; The Consistory or Bench of
<i>Justices</i>, who lived in that quarter where the murder
was committed,<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> placed the party being brought
back from the <i>City of Refuge</i>, in the Court, or Judgment-Hall,
and diligently enquired and examined
the cause, who if he were found guilty of voluntary
murder, then was he punished with death, but if otherwise
the Fact were found casual, then did they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
safely conduct the party back again to the <i>City of
Refuge</i>, where he enjoyed his liberty, not only within
the walls of the City, but within certain Territories
and bounds of the City, being confined to such
and such limits, until the death of the <i>High Priest</i>, that
was in those days, at what time it was lawful for the
offender to return and come into his own City, and
unto his own house, even unto the City from whence
he fled, <i>Josh. 20. 6.</i> By this means the offender, though
he was not punished with death, yet he lived for
the time a kind of exile, for his own humiliation, and
for the abatement of his wrath, who was the <i>avenger
of blood</i>. The <i>Areopagitæ</i><a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> had a proceeding against
mans slaughter not much unlike, punishing the offender
ἀπενιαυτισμῷ, with a <i>years banishment</i>: Why the
time of this exilement was limited to the death of
the <i>High Priest</i> at that time, is not agreed upon by
Expositors. But it is most probably thought, that
the offender was therefore confined within that
City as within a Prison, during the <i>High Priest</i>’s life,<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>
because the offence did most directly strike against
him, as being amongst men, ἄρχηγος, <i>Ac princeps sanctitatis</i>,
<i>The chief God on earth</i>.</p>

<p>Before we treat of their Feasts, it will be needful,
by way of Preface, to understand somewhat
concerning the divisions of their <i>Days</i>,
<i>Hours</i>, <i>Weeks</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Their <i>Day</i> was two-fold; <i>Natural</i>, containing <i>day</i>
and <i>night</i>, and consisting of 24 hours; or <i>Artificial</i>,
beginning at <i>Sun-rising</i> and ending at <i>Sun-set</i>. Of
this is that, <i>Are there not twelve hours in the day?</i>
<i>John 11. 9.</i></p>

<p>The <i>Natural day</i> was again two-fold: <i>Civil</i>, <i>a
working-day</i>, which was destined for civil businesses
and works: this began at <i>Sun-rising</i>, and held till the

<p>Their night was divided into four <i>quarters</i>, or
<i>greater hours</i>, termed four <i>Watches</i>, each <i>Watch</i> containing
three <i>lesser hours</i>. The first they called <i>Caput
vigiliarum</i>, the beginning of the watches, <i>Lam. 2. 19.</i>
the second was the middle watch, <i>Judg. 7. 19.</i> not so
termed, because there were only three <i>watches</i>, as
<i>Drusius</i><a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> would perswade, but because it dured
till <i>midnight</i>. The <i>third watch</i>, began at <i>midnight</i>, and
held till three of the clock in the morning. If he come
in the <i>second</i>, or <i>third watch</i>, <i>Luk. 12. 38.</i> The <i>last</i>, called
the <i>morning watch</i>, <i>Exod. 14. 24.</i> began at three of
the clock, and ended at six in the morning. In the
<i>fourth watch</i> of the night, <i>Jesus</i> went out unto them,
<i>Mat. 14. 25.</i> These <i>Watches</i> also were called by other
names, according to that part of the night which
closed each watch. The <i>first</i> was termed ὀψὲ, the <i>even</i>.
The <i>second</i>, μεσονύκτιον <i>Midnight</i>. The <i>third</i> ἀλεκτοροφωνία,
<i>Cock-crowing</i>. The <i>fourth</i> πρωῒ, the <i>Dawning</i>. <i>Ye
know not when the Master of the house will come, at Even,
or at Midnight, or at Cock-crowing, or at the
Dawning</i>, <i>Mark 13. 35.</i></p>

<p>The day was likewise divided into four <i>quarters</i>,
as appeareth by the Parable of the Labourers hired
into the Vineyard, <i>Mat. 20.</i> The <i>first quarter</i> began
at six of the clock in the morning, and held till nine.
The <i>second quarter</i> ended at twelve of the clock. The
<i>third quarter</i> at three in the after-noon. The <i>fourth
quarter</i> at six of the night. The first <i>quarter</i> was called
the <i>third hour</i>, <i>vers. 3.</i> The second <i>quarter</i>, the <i>sixth
hour</i>, <i>vers. 5.</i> The third <i>quarter</i>, the <i>ninth hour</i>, <i>vers. 5.</i>
The last <i>quarter</i>, the <i>eleventh hour</i>, <i>vers. 6.</i></p>

<p>Where note, that the three first quarters had their
names from the hour of the day, which closed the
quarter (for they began their count of their lesser
hours, from six a clock in the morning, and our 6,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. was their 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12.) only the last was called the <i>eleventh
hour</i>, by our <i>Saviour Christ</i>; whereas among the
common people, it either was called, or should have
been called, by proportion with the rest, the
<i>twelfth hour</i>; to intimate unto us, that though <i>God</i>
in his mercy accept <i>labourers</i> into his Vineyard <i>eleven
hours</i> of the day, yet he seldome calleth any of the
<i>twelfth</i>; for that is rather an hour to discharge servants,
than to admit new.</p>

<p>Some Expositors finding mention of the dawning
of the day, in this Parable, <i>vers. 1.</i><a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> They reckon
the 4 <i>quarters</i> of the day after this manner. <i>Hora prima</i>,
<i>Hora tertia</i>, <i>Hora sexta</i>, <i>Hora nona</i>. Where first
they err, in taking the <i>dawning</i> of the day for the
<i>first hour</i> of the day; for πρωὶ the <i>dawning</i>, signifieth
the <i>last quarter of the night</i>, called the <i>Morning watch</i>.
Secondly, they err in making the <i>last quarter of the
day</i> to be the <i>ninth hour</i>, for what then shall become
of the <i>eleventh hour</i>, mentioned in the same Parable?</p>

<p>By this division of the day into these four <i>quarters</i>,
or <i>greater hours</i>, the <i>Evangelists</i> are reconciled touching
our <i>Saviour</i>’s Passion. He was crucified at the
third hour, <i>Mark 15. 25.</i> S. <i>John</i> intimateth his examination
before <i>Pilate</i>, to have been <i>Hora quasi sexta</i>,
<i>about the sixth hour</i>, <i>John 19. 14.</i> In the first place, understand
by his crucifying, not <i>his hanging on the
Cross</i>, which was not till the <i>sixth hour</i>, <i>Luk. 23. 44.</i>
nor his <i>expiration</i>, which was not till the <i>ninth hour</i>,
<i>Mar. 15. 34.</i> but his <i>examination</i> under <i>Pilate</i>, at which
time the people cried out, <i>Crucifie him, Crucifie him</i>;
and then the third and sixth hour will easily be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
reconciled, for these two hours immediately following
one another, what was done on the third hour, might
truly be said to be done about the sixth.</p>

<p>Lastly, This sheweth that the hours among the
<i>Jews</i> were of two sorts; some lesser, of which the
day contained twelve: others <i>greater</i>, of which the
day contained four, as hath been above shewn: the
lesser are termed <i>hours of the day</i>, <i>Are there not twelve
hours of the day?</i> <i>John 11. 9.</i> The greater, some term
<i>hours of the Temple</i>, or <i>hours of prayer</i>. <i>Peter</i> and <i>John</i>
went up into the <i>Temple</i>, at the <i>ninth hour of prayer</i>,
<i>Acts 3. 1.</i> But in truth there are but three hours of
prayer, the <i>third</i>, the <i>sixth</i>, and the <i>ninth</i>.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> The
<i>third</i> instituted by <i>Abraham</i>, the <i>sixth</i> by <i>Isaac</i>, and the
<i>ninth</i> by <i>Jacob</i>. The <i>third hour</i> the <i>Holy Gost</i> descended
upon the <i>Apostles</i>, <i>Acts 2. 15.</i> About the <i>sixth</i> <i>Peter</i>
went up to the house-top to pray, <i>Acts 10. 9.</i> At the
<i>ninth</i>, <i>Peter</i> and <i>John</i> went into the <i>Temple</i>, <i>Acts 3. 1.</i></p>

<p>From these greater hours of the day and night,
the <i>Canonical hours</i>,<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> in use in the <i>Roman Church</i>, had
their beginning; each <i>Canonical</i> hour containeth
three lesser hours, so that in the whole night and day
there are eight <i>Canonical hours</i>. At six of the clock
in the evening began the first, and that is termed <i>Hora
vespertina</i>; or <i>vespertinum</i> simply, (<i>officium</i> being
understood) their <i>Vespertine</i>. At nine of the clock at
night began the second, and that is termed <i>Completorium</i>,
their <i>Completory</i>. At midnight began the third,
<i>Nocturnum</i>, their <i>Nocturn</i>. At three of the clock in the
morning, began their <i>Matutinum</i>, their <i>Matines</i>.
The Canonical hours for their day-service were
named, <i>Hora prima</i>, <i>tertia</i>, <i>sexta</i>, <i>nona</i>. Their first
hour began from six of the clock in the morning,
and held till nine: the third from nine till twelve,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the sixth from twelve till three, the ninth from three
till six at night.</p>

<p>The Dial in use among the ancient <i>Jews</i>, differed
from that in use among us: theirs were a kind of stairs;
the time of the day was distinguished, <i>not by lines</i>, but
by <i>steps</i>, or <i>degrees</i>; the shade of the Sun every half
hour moved forward to a new <i>degree</i>. In the Dial
of <i>Ahaz</i>, the <i>Sun</i> went back ‎‏מעלות‏‎ <i>Magnoloth</i>, <i>degrees</i>,
or <i>steps</i>, not <i>lines</i>, <i>Isai. 38. 8.</i></p>

<p>Their weeks were two-fold; the one was <i>ordinary</i>
consisting of <i>seven daies</i>, the other <i>extraordinary</i> and
<i>Prophetical</i>, consisting of <i>seven years</i>. <i>Dan. 9. 24.</i> The
first is termed <i>Hebdomas diaria</i>, <i>a week of daies</i>; the
second, <i>Hebdomas annalis</i>, <i>a week of years</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Hebrews</i> at first measured their moneths according
to the course of the <i>Sun</i>, whence they are called
<i>Menses solares</i>; and then every moneth consisted
of thirty daies. The waters prevailed from the seventeenth
day of the second moneth, <i>Gen. 17. 13.</i> unto
the seventh day of the seven moneth, <i>Gen. 8. 4.</i>
that is, full five moneths. If we will number the
daies, they were an hundred and fifty, <i>Gen. 7. 24.</i>
Whereby it appeareth, that every moneth contained
full thirty daies. After the <i>Israelites</i> departure
out of <i>Egypt</i>, then they measured their moneths by
the course of the Moon; they are termed <i>Menses Lunares</i>:
they contained either thirty daies, and then
they were called <i>Menses pleni</i>, <i>full moneths</i>: or twenty
nine daies, and then they were called <i>Menses cavi</i>,
<i>Deficient Moneths</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Sun</i> exceedeth the <i>Moon</i> in her course eleven
daies, hence<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> every third or second year, one
month was inserted. Now because the twelfth moneth
in the <i>Hebrew Kalender</i> was called <i>Adar</i>, hence when
a month was inserted, the last was called <i>Ve-adar</i>,the
second <i>Adar</i>.</p>

<p>Before their captivity in <i>Babylon</i>, they counted

number. The <i>First, Second, Third moneth, &amp;c.</i> After
their return from <i>Babylon</i>, they called them by these
names:</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of their Feasts.</i></span></h3>

<p>Before we descend to their particular <i>Feasts</i>; First
we will see their manner of Feasting in general.
Their ordinary meals, as they were not many in a
day, so neither were they costly. They were called
<i>Arucoth</i>,<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> which word signifieth properly, such
fare as Travellers and Way-faring men use on their
journeys. The word is used, <i>Jer. 40. 5.</i> <i>So the chief
Steward gave him victuals, and a reward, and let him
go.</i> Likewise, <i>Pro. 15. 17.</i> <i>Better is a dinner of green herbs
where love is</i>. The extroardinary and more liberal kind
of entertainment, by way of Feasting, was commonly
called <i>Mischte</i>,<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> from their liberal drinking at such
meetings. There was also another kind of feasting,
wherein they made merry together, eating the
remainders of their Sacrifices; this they termed
<i>Chag</i>.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> From this custom of having a feast at the
end of their Sacrifices, the <i>Christians</i> of the <i>Primitive
Church</i> instituted their <i>Love-feasts</i> to succeed the
<i>Lords Supper</i>:<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> In both these greater and more solemn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
<i>Feasts</i>, there were some Ceremonies used by them, as
<i>preparatory to the Feast</i>, others in their giving thanks,
others in <i>their gesture at Table</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>Ceremonies preparatory</i> were principally these
three: 1. <i>Salutations.</i> 2. <i>Washing the feet of the guests.</i>
3. <i>Pouring Oyl on them.</i></p>

<p>Their <i>Salutations</i> were testified either <i>by words</i>, or
some <i>humble gesture of the body</i>. By <i>words</i>, and then
these were the usual forms; <i>The Lord be with you</i>: or
<i>The Lord bless you</i>, <i>Ruth. 2. 4.</i> From the last of these,
<i>blessing</i> is often taken in Scripture for <i>saluting</i>. If
thou <i>meet</i> any,<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> <i>bless</i> him not, or if any <i>bless</i> thee,
answer him not again, saith <i>Elisha</i> to <i>Gehazi</i>, <i>2 King.
4. 29.</i> The sense is, as our <i>English</i> renders it, <i>Salute him
not</i>. Sometimes they said, <i>Peace be unto thee</i>; <i>peace be
upon thee</i>, <i>Go in peace</i>, and such like: <i>When ye come into
an house salute the same; and if the house be worthy, let
your peace come upon it, but if it be not worthy, let your
peace return to you</i>, <i>Matth. 10. 12, 13.</i> By <i>gesture</i>; their
<i>salutations</i> were signified sometimes by <i>prostrating the
whole body</i>; sometimes by <i>kissing the feet</i>, <i>Luke 7. 38.</i>
commonly by an <i>ordinary kiss</i>.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> <i>Moses</i> went out to
meet his father-in-law, and did obeysance, and <i>kissed
him</i>, <i>Exod. 18. 7.</i> Moreover, <i>Joseph kissed</i> all his Brethren,
and wept upon them, <i>Gen. 45. 15.</i> This Saint
<i>Paul</i> calleth an <i>holy kiss</i>, <i>1 Cor. 16. 20.</i> S. <i>Peter</i>, a <i>kiss
of charity</i>, <i>1 Pet. 5. 14.</i> <i>Tertullian</i><a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> calleth it <i>Osculum
pacis</i>, <i>A kiss of peace</i>. These were <i>kisses</i> which
a <i>Cato</i> might give, and a <i>Vestal</i> receive: Of this sort
the <i>Jews</i> had three kinds;<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> <i>A kiss of salutation</i>,<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
which hath been specified by some of those former
instances. <i>A kiss of valediction</i>:<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> Wherefore hast
thou not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters,
<i>Gen. 31. 28.</i> <i>A kiss of homage</i>;<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> the word signifieth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
a <i>kiss of state</i> or <i>dignity</i>, but it was to testifie
their <i>homage</i>, and acknowledgment of their <i>Kings</i>
Soveraignty. Then <i>Samuel</i> took a Vial of Oyl,
and poured it upon <i>Saul</i>’s head, and <i>kissed</i> him,
<i>1 Sam. 10. 1.</i> And unto this they refer that in the second
<i>Psalm</i>, <i>Kiss the son, least he be angry</i>. These <i>salutions</i>,
howsoever they were such as were used mutually,
sometimes in their meetings abroad upon the way, yet
were they such, as were used also in their entertainment,
as clearly appeareth by many of those fore quoted
examples.</p>

<p>The second <i>Ceremony preparatory</i> was <i>washing
their feet</i>.<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> And the man brought the men into <i>Joseph</i>’s
house, and gave them water, and they did <i>wash their
feet</i>, <i>Gen. 43. 34.</i> This office was commonly performed
by servants, and the meanest of the family, as
appeareth by our <i>Saviour Christ</i>, who to leave an example
of humility behind him, <i>washed his Disciples
feet</i>, <i>Joh. 13. 5.</i> And <i>Abigail</i>, when <i>David</i> took her to
wife, said Behold, let thine hand-maid be a servant
to <i>wash the feet</i> of the servants of my <i>Lord</i>, <i>1 Sam. 25.
41.</i> For this purpose they had certain Vessels in readiness
for such imployments: that which our <i>Saviour</i>
used, we translate a <i>Basin</i>, <i>John 13. 5.</i> He poured
out water into a <i>Basin</i>. The word νιπτὴς there used
signifieth in general a <i>Washpot</i>, and is there used for
that which in strict propriety of speeches, the <i>Grecians</i>
termed ποδόνιπτρον, (<i>i.</i>) <i>A Washpot for our feet</i>; Some
may here make the question, whence this water
was poured? I see no inconvenience, if we say, that
there were usually in their Dining-rooms greater
vessels, from which they poured out into lesser, according
as they needed; of which sort it is not improbably
thought<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> that those Water-pots were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
mentioned, <i>John 2. 6.</i> There were set there <i>six Water-pots</i>
of stone, after the manner of the <i>purifying</i> of the
<i>Jews</i>. By <i>purifying</i> there, understand this complemental
<i>washing</i> of which we treat: Now if we consider
the washing of their hands, usual and commendable
in it self, though superstitiously abused
by <i>Scribes</i> and <i>Pharisees</i>, and the washing of their
feet, before and after meal, (for our <i>Saviour</i> washed
his Disciples feet after supper) which second washing,
the <i>Hebrews</i> say it was in use only at the <i>Passover</i>,
there must needs be use of grate store of water
in their greater Feasts; and therefore no marvel, if
many and capacious vessels stood in readiness. Farther,
we are to note, that as the office was servile and
base, so the vessel: which observation giveth light
to that, <i>Psal. 60. 8.</i> <i>Moab is my wash pot</i>; that is, the
<i>Moabites</i> shall be basely subject unto me, as the pot in
which <i>I wash my feet</i>.</p>

<p>The third <i>Ceremony preparatory</i>, was <i>pouring out of
oyl</i>. A woman in the City brought an Alabaster
box of oyntment, and stood at his feet behind him
weeping, and begun to wash his <i>feet with tears</i>, and
did wipe them with the <i>hairs of her head</i>, and kissed
his feet, and <i>anointed them with the ointment</i>, <i>Luk. 7. 37,
38.</i> It was also poured <i>upon the head</i>, whence
in the same place, <i>Christ</i> challengeth the <i>Pharisee</i>
which entertained him, <i>Mine head with oyl thou didst
not anoint</i>, <i>vers. 46.</i> <i>Psal. 23. 5.</i> <i>Thou anointest mine
head with oyl.</i></p>

<p>After these <i>ceremonies of preparation</i> had been performed,
than they proceeded to <i>giving thanks</i>. The
<i>Master of the house</i> sitting down together with his
Guests, took <i>a cup full of wine</i> in his right hand, and
therewith begun his <i>consecration</i>, after this manner;<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
<i>Blessed be thou, O Lord our God, the King of the world,
which createst the fruit of the Vine.</i> Having said thus,
he first lightly tasted of the Wine, and from him it
pass’d round the Table. This grace of thanksgiving,
they call<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> <i>Bircath haiaiin</i>, <i>the blessing of the cup</i>.
With this <i>Christ</i> himself seemeth to have begun his
supper; <i>He took the cup and gave thanks, and said, Take
this and divide it among your selves, for I say unto you I
will not drink of the fruit of the Vine, until the Kingdom
of God shall come</i>, <i>Luk. 22. 17, 18.</i> After <i>the blessing of
the cup, the Master of the house took the bread</i>, which
they did <i>Scindere</i>, but not <i>Abscindere</i>, lightly cut
for the easier breaking thereof, but not cut in sunder;
and holding this in both his hands, he <i>consecrated</i>
it, with these words; <i>Blessed be thou, O Lord our
God, the King of the world, which bringest forth bread out
of the earth</i>. This <i>consecration of bread</i> they termed,<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
<i>Bircath halechem</i>. After the <i>consecration</i>, he <i>brake
the bread</i>, whence the <i>master of the house</i>, or he who
performed these blessings in his stead, was termed<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
<i>Habotsagn</i>, (<i>i.</i> <i>the breaker</i>:) the bread being broken,
he distributed to every one that sat at the table a morsel,
which being done, then they began to feed upon
the other dishes that were provided. This Rite of
blessing both the Cup and the Bread, they observed
only in their solemn Festivales; otherwise they consecrated
the Bread alone, and not the Cup. In their
Feast time, they seasoned their meat with good conference,
such as might either yield matter of instruction,
or exercise their wits; which practice was also
observed in their <i>Christian love feasts</i>.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> Of the first
sort, was that Parable proposed by our blessed <i>Saviour</i>
at a Feast, <i>Luk. 14. 7.</i> Of the second, was <i>Sampson</i>’s
Riddle, which he proposed unto his Companions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
<i>Judg. 14. 12.</i> At the end of the Feast, they again
gave thanks, which was performed in this manner,
either by the <i>Master</i> of the <i>house</i> himself, or by some
guest, if there were any of better note at the table:
He taking a cup of Wine in both his hands, began
thus: <i>Let us bless him who hath fed us with his own,
and of whose goodness we live</i>: Then all the guests
answered; <i>Blessed be he of whose meat we have eaten,
and of whose goodness we live</i>. This <i>grace</i> they called<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a>
<i>Bircath Hamazon</i>. And this is thought<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> to be
the Cup wherewith Christ after Supper commended
the Mystery of his Blood to his Disciples: After this
he which began the Thanksgiving proceedeth, <i>Blessed
be he, and blessed be his name</i>, &amp;c. annexing a longer
prayer, in which he gave thanks: First, for their
present food. Secondly, for their deliverance from
the <i>Egyptian</i> servitude. Thirdly, for the Covenant
of Circumcision. Fourthly, for the Law given by
the Ministry of <i>Moses</i>. Then he prayed, that <i>God</i>
would have mercy: 1. On his people <i>Israel</i>. 2. On his
own City <i>Jerusalem</i>. 3. On <i>Sion</i> the Tabernacle of his
Glory. 4. On the <i>Kingdom</i> of the House of <i>David</i> his
Anointed. 5. That he would send <i>Elias</i> the Prophet.
Lastly, That he would make them worthy of the daies
of the <i>Messiah</i>, and of the life of the world to
come.</p>

<p>This prayer being ended, then all the Guests
which sate at the Table, with a soft and low voice,
said unto themselves in this manner, <i>Fear the Lord
all ye his holy ones, because there is no penury to those that
fear him: The young Lyons do want and suffer hunger,
but those that seek the Lord want no good thing</i>. Afterward,
he which began the thanksgiving, <i>blessing the
cup</i> in the same form of words as he used at the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
sitting down saying; <i>Blessed be thou, O Lord God, the
King of the world, which createst the fruit of the Vine</i>:
and therewith he drank a little of the Wine, and so
the cup passed round the table. Thus they began and
ended their Feast, with the <i>blessing of a cup</i>: this cup
they termed ‎‏כוס הלל‏‎ <i>Cos hillel</i>, <i>Poculum</i> ὑμνήσεως, <i>A cup
of thanksgiving</i>; and <i>both these cups</i> are mentioned
by Saint <i>Luke</i>; and, which is worth our observation,
the word of <i>Consecration</i> whereby it was instituted,
as part of the Blessed Sacrament in the <i>New Testament</i>,
were added only to the last cup. <i>This cup is
the New Testament in my blood, which it is shed for you.</i>
After all this, they sung<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> Hymns and Psalms, which
also was practised by our blessed Saviour, <i>Mark 14.
26.</i> So that howsoever he used not any superstitions
either then practised, or since added by after <i>Jewes</i>,
(as the drinking of four cups of wine,<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> or the
breaking of the bread with all ten fingers,<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> in allusion
to the ten Commandments, &amp;c.) yet in the beginning,
and ending, we see his practice suitable with
theirs. If any desire a larger discourse of these Blessings,
noted out of the <i>Rabbines</i>, let him read <i>P. Fagius</i><a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
his Comment on <i>Deut. 8. 10.</i> From whom I have borrowed
a great part of what herein I have delivered.
If any shall here object, that I seem to make the <i>blessed
Sacrament</i> of our Lords Body and Blood, a <i>Jewish Ceremony</i>;
I answer, no: For as a kind of initiatory purification
by water, was used before by the <i>Jews</i> of
old, and no <i>Proselite</i> was admitted into the <i>Church</i>
of the <i>Jews</i>, without this purification: yet it was
no more a <i>Sacrament</i> to them, than <i>Circumcision</i> was
to <i>Turks</i> and <i>Saracens</i>. Thus, neither was breaking
the bread <i>Sacramental</i> to the <i>Jew</i>, but then it became
a <i>Sacrament</i>, when <i>Christ</i> said of it; This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
is my body. This cup is the <i>New Testament</i> in my
blood, <i>&amp;c.</i> <i>Luke 22. 19.</i> The <i>Jews</i> could not say,
The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the
Communion of the Blood of Christ? <i>1 Corinthians
10. 16.</i></p>

<p>The last thing considerable in their Feasts, is their
<i>gesture</i>. In the days of our <i>Saviour</i> it is apparent,<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>
that the gesture of the <i>Jews</i> was such as the <i>Romans</i>
used. The table being placed in the middest, round
about the table were certain beds, sometimes two,
sometimes three, sometimes more, according to the
number of the guests; upon these they lay down in
manner as followeth. Each bed contained three
persons, sometimes four, seldom or never more. If
one lay upon the bed, then he rested the upper part
of his body upon the left elbow, the lower part lying
at length upon the bed: but if many lay on the
bed, then the uppermost did lie at the beds head,
laying his feet behind the second’s back: in like
manner the third or fourth did lye, each resting his
head in the others bosom. Thus <i>John</i> leaned on <i>Jesus
bosom</i>, <i>John 13. 23.</i> This first is an argument of <i>special
love</i> towards him whom the <i>Master of the house</i>
shall take into his own <i>bosome</i>, John, <i>he was the beloved
Disciple</i>. Secondly, an argument of <i>parity</i>, amongst
others, resting in one anothers bosom. <i>Many shall
come from the East and West; and shall sit down with
Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob</i>, <i>Mat. 8. 11.</i> And where
shall they sit? In <i>Abraham</i>’s <i>bosom</i>, <i>Luke 16. 22.</i> that is,
they shall all sit at the same table, be partakers of the
same glory. Thus <i>Christ</i>, he was in the <i>bosom of his
Father</i>, <i>John 1. 18.</i>, that is, in the <i>Apostles</i> phrase, <i>He
thought it no robbery to be equal with his Father</i>. Their
tables were perfectly circular, or round, whence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
their manner of sitting was termed<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> <i>Mesibah</i>, <i>a
sitting round</i>; and their phrase of inviting their guests
to sit down, was, <i>Sit round</i>: We will not sit round
until he come hither, <i>1 Sam. 16. 11.</i> Again, Thy
children shall be as Olive-plants <i>round</i> about thy
table, <i>Psal. 128. 3.</i> This custom of lying along upon
a <i>bed</i>, when they took their meat, was also in use in
<i>Ezekiel</i>’s time; Thou satest upon a stately <i>bed</i>, and a
table prepared before it, <i>Ezek. 23. 41.</i> And<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> whether
this were the custome of the ancient <i>Hebrews</i>,
I leave to be discussed by others. But unto this also
doth <i>Amos</i> allude; They laid themselves down upon
cloaths laid to pledge by every Altar, <i>Amos 2. 8.</i> that
is, the <i>garments</i><a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> taken to pledge they use in stead
of <i>beds</i>, when at their Altars they eat things sacrificed
to Idols: Yea, the plucking off their shooes
when they went to table, implieth this custom of lying
at the Table, to have been very ancient. The plucking
off their shooes seemeth to have been generally
received, when they were in <i>Egypt</i>; for this cause is it
that they had a strict charge in eating the <i>Passover</i>,
to have their shooes on their feet, for greater expedition.
The reason why they usually pluckt them off,
was, for the clean keeping of their Beds on which
they lay. Here, seeing the rule of observing the <i>Passover</i>
requireth, that it should be eaten with their
shooes on their feet, which argueth rather <i>standing</i>
than <i>lying upon a bed</i>: it may be demanded, Whether
<i>Christ transgressed</i> not against the first Institution
thereof, in the manner of his sitting at the table? <i>Tremelius</i>
answereth thus; and, in my mind, fully:<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> We
must know, saith he, that <i>Exod. 12.</i> it was commanded,
after what manner they, ready to depart out of
<i>Egypt</i>, should eat the <i>Passover</i> at that time; for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
necessity of that time so required, namely, an hasty
eating thereof; but afterward, in the Law, where it
is commanded that this Ceremony of the <i>Paschal</i>
should be renewed every year, those words are not
added. Wherefore all the <i>Hebrew Doctors</i>, both ancient
and modern, do teach with one joynt consent,
that the Commandment of <i>sprinkling the door-posts
with blood</i>, of <i>having on their shooes</i>, of <i>girding their
loyns</i>, of <i>taking staves in their hands</i>, and <i>eating the
Lamb in hast</i>; did not extend it self to the generations
following, but only to have concerned that
very night, wherein they departed out of <i>Egypt</i>:<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a>
Yea, it was an ancient tradition amongst them, that
when they did in after-times eat the <i>Passover</i>, they
would sit down, or lean upon a bed, as our <i>Saviour</i>
and his Disciples did, in token of their deliverance
obtained.</p>

<p>The parties that gave entertainment at their <i>Feasts</i>
were two:<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> 1. The <i>Master of the house</i>. 2. The <i>Master
of the Feast</i>; they differed thus: The <i>Master of the

<i>Pater familias</i>. The <i>Master of the Feast</i> was termed ‎‏בעל משתה‏‎

add a third sort, whom they would have to
be <i>Præfecti morum</i>, in Greek they were termed
ὀινόπται. Their Office was thought to have been the
inspection of the Guests, that none should disorder
themselves by drinking too much; whence they
were called ὀφθαλμοὶ <i>the eyes of the Feast</i>. Such kind of
Officers were in use in <i>Ahasuerosh</i> his Court, <i>Esth. 1. 8.</i>
and likewise among the <i>Athenians</i>;<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> but whether
any such belonged unto the <i>Jews</i> is justly doubted.</p>

<p>The ancient <i>Jews</i>, they were both Hospital, ready
to entertain, and also liberal in their entertainment:
Their Hospitality is commended throughout
the Scripture, though now it be grown out of use
among them, as appeareth by that Proverbial speech
concerning the entertainment of a friend:<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> <i>That
the first day he is Oreach, a guest</i>: <i>the second Toreach, a
burden</i>: <i>the third Barach, a runnagate</i>. Their liberality
appeared by remembring the poor at their Feasts,
by sending them portions. Send portions unto them
for whom nothing is prepared, <i>Neh. 8. 10.</i> This<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a>
was afterwards practised by Heathens, who in their
solemn Feasts did not onely entertain their Guests
for the present, but did also allow them certain junkets
to carry away with them. These they termed
ἀποφόρητα: and likewise, unto their friends who were
absent they sent portions, which they termed μερίδας.
This observation giveth light to that <i>Canon</i> in the
<i>Laodicean Counsel</i>, which forbiddeth the <i>Christians</i> in
their love feasts, μέρη αἴρειν, to <i>send portions</i>, the reason
of which prohibition, I conceive to be three-fold.
First, that <i>Christians</i> might not symbolize with <i>Heathen</i>
people. Secondly, That none presuming that
their portions should be sent them, might absent
themselves. Thirdly, that those present (especially
the poorer sort, as it often falleth out) might not be
injured, by having the best of their provision sent away
in such portions.</p>

<p>Here we may note, for conclusion, that as the time
of their supper was towards the evening, and then
they gave greatest entertainment; So the time of
their dinner was about the sixth hour of the day;
that is, as we count, about Noon. Kill meat and
make ready, for the men shall eat with me at <i>Noon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>

<p>Moreover we may here note the difference between
those <i>three cups</i> mentioned in Scripture, ποτήριον
τῆς εὐλογίας, <i>1 Cor. 10. 19.</i> The <i>cup of blessing</i>, and
this is applied to those several cups used in their
solemn Feasts, because of those blessings or thanksgiving
annexed. Secondly, ποτήριον εἰς παράκλησιν, <i>Jer. 16.
7.</i> The <i>cup of consolation</i>; this was so called, because
it was sent by special friends in time of mourning, as
intending by this drinking to put away sorrow and
grief from the mourner. Thirdly, ποτήριον σωτηρίας,
<i>Psal. 116. 13.</i> <i>The cup of salvation</i>: this was used commonly
after their <i>Peace-offerings</i>, which were vowed
in way of thankfulness for benefits obtained. Whence
the <i>Seventy Elders</i> commonly translate <i>a Peace offering</i>,
σωτήριον, <i>A sacrifice of salvation</i>, or <i>salvation it self</i>.</p>

<p>The word ‎‏שבת‏‎ <i>Schabbath</i>, from whence our
<i>English</i> word <i>Sabbath</i> is derived, signifieth
<i>Rest</i>, and is applied to all <i>solemn Festivals</i>. <i>They
polluted my Sabbaths</i>, <i>Ezek. 20. 21.</i> that is, my <i>Feasts</i>.
Sometimes it is applyed to the <i>whole week</i>, <i>Jejuno bis
in Sabbato</i>, <i>I fast twice in the week</i>. Sometimes, and
that most frequently, it is used for that 7th day which
God had set apart for his own service. This last was
holy, either by a simple holiness which belonged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
to it, as was the seventh day; or else by a double
holiness occasioned by some solemn Feast upon the
same day, and then it was called, <i>Sabbatum magnum</i>,
<i>a great Sabbath</i>, <i>John 19. 36.</i> For on that <i>Sabbath day</i>
of which S. <i>John</i> speaketh, the <i>Feast of the Passover</i>
hapned that year.</p>

<p>The week days are termed by the <i>Hebrew</i>, ‎‏חולים‏‎
<i>Cholim</i>, <i>prophane days</i>; by the Greek ἐνεργοὶ, <i>working
days</i>: but when they speak of them altogether, τὸ μεταξὺ
σαββάτων, <i>the space of time between two Sabbaths</i>.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a>
This was the time upon which the <i>Gentiles</i> desired
to hear <i>Paul</i> <i>Act. 13. 42.</i> In respect of the different degrees
of holiness on days, the <i>Sabbath-day</i> is not unfitly
compared to a <i>Queen</i>, or rather to those whom
they termed <i>Primary wives</i>; other <i>Feast days</i> to <i>Concubines</i>,
or <i>half wives</i>; <i>working-days</i>, to <i>hand-maids</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>preparation</i> to the <i>Sabbath</i> begun at<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> three
of the clock in the afternoon; the <i>Hebrews</i> called
this ‎‏ערב השבת‏‎ <i>Gnereb haschabbath</i>, the <i>Sabbath eve</i>.
By the ancient <i>Fathers</i> it was called<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> <i>cœna pura</i>; the
phrase is borrowed from <i>Pagans</i>, whose Religion
taught them in their Sacrifices to certain of their
<i>Gods</i> and <i>Goddesses</i>, to prepare themselves by a strict
kind of holiness; at which time of their preparation
they did pertake of a certain Supper, which as it
consisted of choice meats, such as those <i>Heathens</i>
deemed more holy than others: so it was eat with
the observation of <i>Holy Rites</i> and <i>Ceremonies</i>: Hence
they themselves were said at this time of their preparation
to be in <i>In casto</i>, and their preparatory Supper
termed, <i>Cœna pura</i>. Thus we see the reason why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the <i>Fathers</i> called the <i>Sabbath-eve</i>, <i>Cœnam puram</i>. By
the <i>Evangelists</i> it was called παρασκευὴ, <i>A preparation</i>,
<i>Mark 15. 42.</i> For distinction sake, we may call that
fore-time of the day προπαρασκευὴ, <i>A fore-preparation</i>.
For the whole day was a kind of preparation, as will
appear by the particulars then forbidden. First on
this day they might go no more than three <i>Parsas</i>;
now a <i>Parsa</i> contained so much ground as an ordinary
man might go ten of them in a day. Secondly,
Judges might not then sit in Judgment upon life and
death, as is shewn in the Chapter of Translation of
Feasts.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> Thirdly, all sorts of Artificers were forbidden
to work, only three excepted, <i>shoomakers</i>,
<i>Taylors</i>, and <i>Scribes</i>; the two former for repairing of
apparel, the other for fitting themselves by study to
expound the Law the next day, and these were permitted
but half the preparation time to work.</p>

<p>Concerning the sanctification of the <i>Sabbath</i> day
it self, in corrupter times some things the <i>Jews</i> added
over and above that which God commanded.
In other things they took liberty where <i>God</i> granted
none. In the first they were <i>superstitious</i>, in the second
<i>sacrilegious</i>.</p>

<p>They took liberty: There were two thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
Cubits between the <i>Ark</i> and the <i>Camp</i>, when they
marched; <i>Josh. 3. 4.</i> and in probability the same proportion
was observed when they rested: this distance
of ground some interpret to be one mile, some
two; some measuring it according to a lesser, others
according to a longer Cubit, which they term a <i>Geometrical
Cubit</i>: But all agree in this, that these two
thousand cubits was a <i>Sabbath</i> days journey, though
none, as I know, have observed the reason why it
was so called, which I take to be this: On the <i>Sabbath</i>
day they were all to repair to the place of <i>God</i>’s
publike worship, which was two thousand cubits distant
from those who camped nearest: Hence follow
four Propositions. First, That two thousand
Cubits any where, by proportion, might be called a
<i>Sabbath dayes journy</i>. Secondly, That to those who
dwelt in the Camps more remote from the <i>Ark</i>, a
<i>Sabbath daies journy</i> was more than two thousand
Cubits. Thirdly, That it is now lawful on the <i>Sabbath
day</i>, to joyn with the Congregation in the place
of <i>God</i>’s publick worship, though remote. Fourthly,
That it was unlawful for the <i>Jews</i> hereupon to take
liberty to walk idlely whither they would, if it were
not more then two thousand Cubits, pretending it to
be but a <i>Sabbath daies journey</i>.</p>

<p>They added unto that which God commanded,
1. God said, <i>Remember to keep holy a seventh day</i>: in
which words, <i>God</i> sanctified one day to be <i>Sabbatum</i>,<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a>
they added <i>Sabbatulum</i>, so they termed that
additament of time which they annexed to the <i>Sabbath</i>.
This addition of time was <i>two-fold</i>: some began
the <i>Sabbath</i> sooner than others; this was done
by the <i>Jews</i> dwelling at <i>Tiberias</i>, because they dwelling
in a Valley, the Sun appeared not to them so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
soon as it did to others. Some again continued the
<i>Sabbath</i> longer than others: this was done by those
dwelling at <i>Tsepphore</i>, a City placed upon the top of
a Mountain, so that the Sun shined longer to them,
than it did to others. Thus both of these did <i>Addere
de profano ad sacrum</i>; add somewhat of the working
day, immediately going before, or immediately following
after: none diminished of the <i>Sabbath</i>.
Hence<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> <i>R. Jose wished that his portion might be with those
that began the Sabbath, with those of <span class="antiqua">Tiberias</span>, and ended
with those of <span class="antiqua">Tsepphore</span></i>.</p>

to the time of <i>Manna</i>:<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> the reason is there alledged,
why they should prepare that day for the
morrow, because upon the <i>Sabbath</i> day they should
not find it in the field. The <i>Jews</i> extend this Command
to all Ages; and therefore they dressed no meat
this day: this haply was the reason, that the <i>Heathen</i>
people thought they fasted<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> on the <i>Sabbath</i>,

<p>1. <i>Works of Charity</i>: <i>God</i>, that allowed them to
lead their Oxe and Ass to water on the <i>Sabbath</i>, <i>Luke
13.</i> to make their lives more comfortable, much more
allowed man liberty to dress convenient food for himself
and his Family, that they might the more comfortably
perform holy duties. <i>Christ</i> healed on the
<i>Sabbath</i>, therefore, visiting the sick, and the use of
the <i>Physitian</i>, was both then and now lawful.</p>

<p>2. <i>Works tending directly to Gods Worship</i>: not only
killing of sacrifices, and circumcising of children on
that day was allowed; but the <i>Priests</i> might lawfully
blow their Trumpets and Horns on the <i>Sabbath</i> day;
for the assembling of the people, <i>Numb. 20. 2.</i> And
the people might warrantably go from their Houses
to the place of Gods publick worship. By proportion
it is now warrantable for <i>Christians</i>, to ring bells
to assemble the people together on the Lords day;
to take journeys, to joyn with the publick Congregation,
or Preach the Word. Of these we may say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
though they are in their own natures bodily labors,

<i>Passover of the Lamb</i>, because on that day toward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
the evening, the <i>Israelites</i> were commanded according
to their Families to roast a <i>Lamb</i>, and eat it in
their private houses. Secondly, it signifieth that
yearly Festivity which was celebrated on the fifteenth
of <i>Nisan</i>: it may be called the <i>Passover</i> of
<i>sheep and Bullocks</i>, <i>Deut. 16. 2.</i> Otherwise we may call
it the <i>Feast of the Passover</i>; as the fourteenth of <i>Nisan</i>
was called simply the <i>Passover</i>. In the fourteenth day
of the first moneth, is the <i>Passover of the Lord</i>, and in
the fifteenth day of this moneth is the <i>Feast</i>, <i>Num. 28.
16, 17.</i> Toward this Feast we are to understand that
<i>Josiah</i> gave unto the people such a multitude of
Sheep, Lambs, Kids, and Bullocks. Thirdly, it is taken
for the whole solemnity, beginning the Fourteenth
of <i>Nisan</i>, and ending the one and twentieth
of the same moneth. Now the <i>Feast of unleavened
bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover</i>, <i>Luk. 22. 1.</i>
So that in this acception is contained the <i>Feast of unleavened
bread</i> also, notwithstanding, in proper speaking,
the <i>Feast of unleavened bread</i> was a distinct <i>Feast</i>
from the <i>Passover</i>.</p>

<p>First, the <i>Passover</i> was to be kept on the <i>fourteenth
day of the first month, at even</i>. This was their second
Sacrament, in which although they were enjoyned
to eat unleavened bread with the Lamb, yet the
<i>Feast of the unleavened bread</i> began not till the morrow
following, being the <i>fifteenth day of the same
moneth</i>, and lasted seven daies of which only the first
and last were holy Convocations, wherein they might
do no servile work, <i>Levit. 23. 5, 6, 7, 8.</i></p>

<p>Secondly, the <i>Passover</i>, in the age following its
first institution, might not be killed and eaten in any
other place, save only where the <i>Lord</i> did choose to
place his name, which afterward was at <i>Jerusalem</i>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
but the <i>feast of unleavened bread</i>, the <i>Hebrews</i> thought
themselves bound to keep in every place wheresoever
they dwelt, if they could not be at <i>Jerusalem</i>: and
<i>eating of it</i>, they say,<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> <i>depended not upon the eating
of the Passover, but it was a commandment by it self</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Rites</i> and <i>Ceremonies</i> observed by the <i>Jews</i> in
the eating of this Sacrament, their <i>Paschal Lamb</i>,
agreed with those general Ceremonies used in their
solemn Feasts. They <i>blessed the cup</i>, and <i>blessed the
bread</i>, and <i>divided</i> amongst the guests, and <i>washed the
feet</i> of those that sate at the table, as is shewn in the
Chapter of <i>Feasts</i>. The particulars in which it differed
from other Feasts, are delivered in those interrogatories,
or questions proposed in way of <i>Catechism</i>,
by some child, at the time of eating their
<i>Passover</i>, or rather in the answer made unto the child
by him that blessed the table. The question was
thus: What meaneth this service? The form of the
answer was,<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> How different is this night from all
other nights, for all other nights we wash but once,
in this twice (thus <i>Christ</i> when supper was ended
washed his Disciples feet.) In all other nights we eat
either leavened or unleavened bread, in this only
unleavened: In other nights we eat any sort of
herbs, in this night bitter herbs: In all other nights
we eat and drink either sitting or lying, but in this
we lye along. Then he proceeded to declare, that
the <i>Passover</i> was in respect that the <i>Lord passed over</i>
the houses of their Fathers in <i>Egypt</i>. Secondly, He
held up the bitter herbs in his hand, and said; These
bitter herbs which we eat, are in respect that the
<i>Egyptians</i> made the lives of our <i>Fathers bitter in Ægypt</i>.
Thirdly, he held up the unleavened bread in
his hand, and said, This unleavened bread which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
eat, it is in respect that the dough of our Fathers had
not time to be leavened, when the Lord appeared
unto them, and redeemed them out of the hand of
the enemy. This kind of <i>Catechising</i> they say, is commanded,
<i>Exod. 12. 26.</i> They called it ‎‏הגדה‏‎ <i>Haggada</i>,
(i.) <i>Annunciatio</i>, the <i>declaration</i> or <i>shewing forth</i> of the
<i>Passover</i>. Hence the <i>Apostle</i> borroweth this phrase; <i>As
often as ye shall eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye shall
declare, <span class="antiqua">or</span> shew forth, the Lord’s death</i>, <i>1 Cor. 11. 26.</i></p>

<p>Concerning this Lamb they are charged thus:
<i>Upon the tenth of <span class="antiqua">Abib</span> every one shall take a Lamb for
an house, a male of the first year, without blemish, and
this be kept until the fourteenth day of the same month</i>,
<i>Exod. 12. 3. &amp;c.</i> The <i>Lamb</i>, it was either of <i>Sheep</i> or
<i>Goats</i>. For an <i>house</i>, the whole body of the <i>Israelites</i>,
was divided into twelve <i>Tribes</i>, the <i>Tribes</i> into
<i>Families</i>, the <i>Families</i> into <i>Houses</i>: if the <i>House</i> were
too few for the eating of the <i>Lamb</i>, then the next
Neighbour joyned with them in the eating thereof.
The whole Company was termed φρατρία, in the same
sense S. <i>Mark</i> useth συμπόσια, and πρασιαὶ, <i>Mark</i> the
sixth. All these words signifie a <i>society</i>, or <i>company
of guests</i>, <i>so many as can sit at the same table</i>: the latter
word properly signifieth, <i>a bed in a Garden</i>; and thus
in the <i>Gospel</i>, the whole multitude sitting on the
grass, seem to be compared unto a <i>Garden</i>; and their
several <i>societies</i> or <i>companies</i>, unto so many <i>beds in
the Garden</i>. The number of <i>Communicants</i> in this
<i>Paschal society</i> was never less than ten, nor more
than twenty.<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> It followeth in the Text, <i>A male</i>,
to note the masculine and peerless vertue of our <i>Saviour</i>,
whom it did typically shew forth. <i>Of
the first year</i>;<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> which phrase they interpret thus, That
the lamb, after it was eight daies old and forward,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
was allowable to be offered for the <i>Passover</i>, but not
before; because it is said, <i>When a bullock, or a sheep,
or a goat is brought forth, then it shall be seven daies under
the dam, and from the eighth day, and thenceforth,
it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the
Lord</i>, <i>Levit. 22. 27.</i> And the reason of this Law, some
of the <i>Hebrews</i> have thought to be,<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> because in
their Opinion nothing in the world was absolutely
perfect, until a <i>Sabbath</i> had past over it. Moreover if
it were an hour elder then a year, it was unlawful,
because it is said, <i>A male of the first year, without blemish</i>,
as well to admonish the <i>Israelites</i> of their own
personal integrity, as to signifie the absolute perfection
of him who was in truth the <i>Lamb of God</i>. And
this he kept till the <i>fourteenth day of the same month</i>.
The <i>Rabbines</i> affirm<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> four causes of this: <i>First</i>, because
otherwise through the multitude of businesses,
at the time of their departure, they might forget
the <i>Paschal Lamb</i>. <i>Secondly</i>, that in this four
daies space they might have the more certain
knowledge of the Lamb’s perfection. <i>Thirdly</i>,
that by beholding the Lamb so long before their
eyes, they might have the better occasion, in that
space, both to recount with themselves <i>Gods</i> mercy
in their deliverance from <i>Ægypt</i>, and also to instruct
and <i>Catechise</i> their children in that point:
for which respect it was a received Tradition amongst
the <i>Jews</i>, that during the space of these four
daies, their Lamb was tyed to their bed-posts.
<i>Lastly</i>, that in this time of preparation, they might
throughly sit and address themselves for the Oblation.</p>

<p>The time when the <i>Paschal Lamb</i> was to be slain,
was at the <i>Evening</i>, <i>Exod. 12. 6.</i> Or, as the Original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
reads, <i>between the two evenings</i>. Here <i>Divines</i> move
the question, what part of the day should be understood
by this phrase. Some distinguish the <i>two evenings</i>
thus,<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> That there was <i>Vespera Solis</i>, the <i>evening
of the Sun</i>; namely, when the body of the Sun
setteth: and <i>Vespera luminis</i>, <i>the evening of the light</i>,
when the beams and shining of the <i>Sun</i> is also gone
from off the earth; The space or interim between
these <i>two Evenings</i>, is thought to be one hour, and
the third part of an hour; in which space of time,
they say, the <i>Paschal Lamb</i> was slain. Others<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> admit
a greater latitude, and distinguish thus: There is
say they, <i>Vespera declinationis</i>, the <i>Evening of the Sun
declining</i>; and <i>Vespera occasus</i>, the <i>Evening of the Sun
setting</i>; and their meaning is, that their <i>Passover</i> was
offered in this intermediate time, between noon
and night. This latter answer seemeth most agreeable
to the truth. First because by this speech we must
understand a latitude of time wherein might be offered
not only the <i>Passover</i>, but the <i>daily Evening Sacrifice</i>
also, for even that likewise was commanded, <i>Inter
duas Vesperas</i>, <i>between the two evenings</i>, <i>Num. 28. 4.</i> Now
this might be offered in the former part of the after-noon.
The manner of their sacrificing, in regard
of this time, we find thus registred,<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> if we count the
hours according to our usual computations: the <i>daily
sacrifice of the evening Lamb</i> was usually <i>slain</i> between
<i>two</i> and <i>three</i>, it was <i>offered</i> between <i>three</i> and <i>four</i>:
upon the <i>Passover Eve</i> it was slain between <i>one</i> and
<i>two</i>, it was <i>offered</i> about half an hour before <i>three</i>;
but if their <i>Passover Eve</i> hapned to be the same with
their <i>Sabbath Eve</i>, then the daily <i>Evening Sacrifice</i>
was <i>slain</i> between <i>twelve</i> and <i>one</i>, it was offered half
an hour before <i>two</i>; and afterward the <i>Passover</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
Secondly, this agreeth with the Oblation of the true
<i>Paschal Lamb</i>; for, as the time of his crucifying began
in the third hour of the day, with the <i>daily morning
sacrifice</i>, <i>Mark 15. 25.</i> so it ended at the ninth hour,
<i>Mark 15. 34.</i> which was the time of their ordinary
<i>evening sacrifice</i>: but upon their <i>Passover Eve</i>, it was
the time when their <i>Paschal Lamb was slain</i>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the <i>Lamb was to be eaten with bitter
herbs</i>: the reason of this command is, that thereby
they might be moved to thankfulness towards <i>God</i>,
for their deliverance from the <i>Egyptian bondage</i>, in
which their lives were made bitter unto them, <i>Ex. 1. 14.</i></p>

<p>These <i>bitter herbs</i> they dipt in a certain sauce thick
like Mustard, called <i>Charoseth</i>,<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> which thick
sauce (say they)<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> was a memorial of the <i>day</i> wherein
they <i>wrought</i> in <i>Egypt</i>. This is thought of some<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> to
be that wherein <i>Christ</i> diped the sop which he gave to

used to dip the <i>unleavened bread</i> in that sauce <i>Charoseth</i>,
and to eat; then they dipt the bitter herbs in the
<i>Charoseth</i>, and did eat them. It was made<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> of the
Palm-tree branches, or of dry Figs, or of Raisins, which
they stamped and put Vinegar thereto, and seasoned
it, and made it like Clay; and brought it unto the
Table in the night of the <i>Passover</i>.</p>

<p>The other seven daies following the fourteenth of
<i>Nisan</i>, were in strictness of speech a distinct Feast, as is
above-shewed; namely, <i>the Feast of unleavened bread</i>
because in that space of time, no <i>leavened bread</i>
ought to be found in their houses;<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> their degrees<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> of
<i>preparation to this feast</i> are <i>four</i>. 1. <i>Expurgatio fermenti</i>,
<i>the cleansing of</i> all their <i>houshold stuff</i> and <i>vessels</i>, unto
which <i>leaven</i> might haply cleave; and this was done
two or three daies before the <i>Passover</i>. 2. <i>Inquisitio
fermenti</i>, the <i>searching after leaven</i> throughout all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the rooms of their houses, even to the Mouse-holes:
this they did with a waxen Candle, and as <i>Buxtorfus</i>
noteth, upon the night before the <i>Passover</i>: and
<i>Scaliger</i> delivereth it in other words to the same
purpose, namely,<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> that this search was made, <i>Ineunte
quarta decima, usque ad quartam horam post ortum solis</i>.
<i>At the beginning of the fourteenth day, until the fourth
hour after the rising of the Sun.</i> Now, the beginning
of the fourteenth day was the night going before; for
the <i>Jews</i>, in the computation of their Holy-daies,
counted their day from even to even. 3. There was
<i>Exterminatio</i>, or <i>Conflagratio fermenti</i>, <i>A burning of
the leaven</i>; and this was done from the fourth to the
sixth hour, about dinner-time; at which time followed
the last degree, which <i>Scaliger</i> hath ommitted, namely,
<i>Execratio fermenti</i>, the <i>cursing of the leaven</i>, in this
form:<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> <i>Let all that leaven, or whatsoever leavened
thing is in my power, whether it were seen of me, or not
seen, whether cleansed by me, or not cleansed; let all that be
scattered, destroyed, and accounted as the dust of the earth</i>.</p>

<p>In case any did eat leavened bread those seven
daies, the penalty was, that such a <i>soul</i> should be <i>cut
off from Israel</i>, <i>Exod. 12. 15.</i> Which penalty hath
amongst Expositors a three-fold interpretation.<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a>
Some understand thereby such a man to be <i>cut off from
his heavenly inheritance</i>: others, that <i>God</i> would <i>cut
off such from the living by an untimely death</i>: others,
that he should <i>die without children</i>, leaving no posterity
behind him: To this purpose their Proverb is,<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>
<i>A man childless is lifeless</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>Of these three, the first is most probable in this
place, though the same Text may admit the second
interpretation in other places of Scripture, as is declared
in the Chapter of Circumcision. Notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
here let the judicious Reader determine,
whether these words do not imply, besides the secret
actions of God touching the soul of such a Delinquent,
a direction unto the Church how to deal
with parties thus offending by censuring them with Excommunication,
which kind of censure elsewhere the
Scripture calleth, <i>A casting out of the Synagogue</i>, <i>John
16. 2.</i> A speech much like this, <i>A cutting off from Israel</i>.</p>

<p>Three things may be here demanded. First, who
killed the <i>Paschal Lamb</i>? Secondly, where it was
killed? Thirdly, where it was eaten? First, it was
killed by the <i>Priests</i>, <i>2 Chron. 35. 6.</i> Secondly, it was
killed after the first time in the <i>Court of the Temple</i>, the
place which <i>God</i> had chosen. <i>Deut. 16. 6.</i> Thirdly,
the owner of the Lamb took it of the <i>Priest</i>, and did
eat it in his own house at <i>Jerusalem</i>, <i>Christ with his disciples
kept the Passover in an upper-chamber at Jerusalem</i>.<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

</div>

<p>It may further be demanded, whether the Passover
consisted of two suppers, one immediately succeeding
the other? Some affirm it, and their reasons
are these: First, say they, the <i>Passover</i> was eaten
<i>standing</i>, but <i>Christ</i> used another gesture. This argument
of all other is the weakest, for <i>Christ</i> used the
gesture of lying on his body, as well in the eating of
the <i>Passover</i>, as at the consecration of the <i>Sacrament</i>,
and the <i>Jews</i>, generally after the first institution, in
all their <i>Passovers</i>, used rather this posture of their
body, than the other of standing, in token of rest
and security, as appeareth in the <i>Chapter of Feasts</i>. Secondly,
they say, the <i>Paschal Lamb</i> was wont to be
rosted; but in the last <i>Passover</i> which our <i>Saviour</i> celebrated,
there was <i>Jus cui intingebatur panis</i>, <i>Broth
into which he dipped the bread</i>. This reason is as weak
as the former, because though there was a command<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
to eat the <i>Paschal Lamb rosted</i>; yet there was no prohibition
to joyn their ordinary supper with the eating
thereof, and that might admit broth: but, as it is
shewn above, the matter into which the sop was dipped,
was thought to be the sauce <i>Charoseth</i>. Thirdly,
they urge <i>John 13. 2.</i> That the first supper was done,
when <i>Christ</i> arose and washed his Disciples feet, and
after that he gave <i>Judas</i> the sop, which must argue
a second sitting down. This foretelling his <i>Disciples</i>,
that one of them should betray him, is likewise
by Saint <i>Luke</i> recited after the consecration of the
<i>Sacrament</i>. This is the strongest argument, and yet
not of sufficient validity, because by a kind of <i>Prolepsis</i>,
or anticipation of time, it is not unusual, in the
Scripture, to relate that first, which according to the
truth of the History, should be last. Thus <i>John 11.</i>
mention is made of <i>Mary</i> which anointed the <i>Lord</i>,
yet her anointing of him followeth in the next <i>Chapter</i>.
And this same History of betraying <i>Christ</i>, Saint
<i>Matthew</i>, and Saint <i>Mark</i> recite it before the consecration
of the <i>Sacrament</i>. Whence the <i>Jews</i> have a Proverb,<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a>
<i>Non esse prius aut posterius in scriptura</i>; That
<i>first</i> and <i>last</i>, must not be strictly urged in Scripture.
Together with these answers, consider how improbable
it is, that ten persons (for sometimes they were
so few) should eat a second supper, after they had
eaten <i>A Lamb of the first year</i>, which might be an
year old. It is evident also by that of <i>Barabbas</i>, that
it was a received custom on the <i>Passover</i>, to let loose
and enlarge one Prisoner or other. Concerning the
reason hereof, the conjecture is three-fold, Some
think this custom to have been used in memory of
<i>Jonathan</i> the son of <i>Saul</i>, when the people rescued
him from the hands of his Father. Others say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the reason hereof was, that the Feast might be celebrated
with the greater joy and gladness. Others
more probably think, it was done in remembrance of
their deliverance from the <i>Egyptian bondage</i>.</p>

<p>Again, here is to be observed, that the <i>Jews</i>, speaking
of their <i>Passover</i>, did sometimes speak according
to their <i>civil computation</i>, wherein they measured
their days from <i>Sun-rising</i> to <i>Sun-rising</i>: sometimes
according to their <i>sacred computation</i>, which was
from <i>Sun-set</i> to <i>Sun-set</i>. This serveth for the reconciliation
of that, <i>Numb. 12. 18.</i> which seemeth to
make the fourteenth day of the first month, the first
day of unleavened bread. And <i>Josephus</i><a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> telleth us
that they numbered <i>eight days</i> for that Feast. In like
manner the Disciples are said to come unto <i>Christ</i> the
<i>first day of unleavened bread</i>, saying unto him, <i>Where
wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the Passover?</i>
<i>Mat. 26. 17.</i> as if the <i>first day of unleavened bread</i>, were
before the <i>Passover</i>. All these are true according to
the computation of their <i>civil days</i>, though according
to the computation of their <i>Holy-days</i>, the <i>feast
of unleavened bread</i> began the fifteenth day, and continued
seven days only, and the <i>Passover</i> was before
the <i>feast of unleavend bread</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>In the last place we must know, that there was
permitted a <i>second Passover</i> to those who could not
be partakers of the <i>first</i>, by reason either of their uncleanness
by a dead body, or of their far distance
from the place where it was to be offered. This was
to be observed in the second month, the fourteenth
day thereof, according to all the Ordinances of the
first <i>Passover</i>, <i>Numb. 9.</i> Touching that permission of a
<i>second Passover</i>, to those that were in a journey <i>far
off</i>: the <i>Hebrew</i> of this word <i>far off</i>, hath extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
pricks over it, for special consideration.
Hereby the Lord might intimate, that we Gentiles
which were unclean, even dead in trespasses and
sins, and <i>far off</i>, <i>Ephes. 2. 13.</i> should be made <i>nigh</i>
by the blood of <i>Christ</i>, and so partakers of him, the
<i>second Passover</i>. Of this legal Ordinance the <i>Hebrews</i>
say,<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> What is this journey <i>far off</i>? fifteen miles
without the walls of <i>Jerusalem</i>, who so is distant
from <i>Jerusalem</i>, on the fourteenth day of the first
month, fifteen miles or more, when the Sun riseth,
Lo, this is a journey <i>far off</i>; if less than this, it is
not a journey <i>far off</i>, for he may come to <i>Jerusalem</i>
by after midday, though he go on foot, easily. The
Agreement between the <i>Paschal Lamb</i> and <i>Christ</i>
standeth thus,</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of their Pentecost</i></span></h3>

<p>This Feast was called πεντεκοστὴ, <i>the Pentecost</i>;
which word signifieth the <i>fiftieth day</i>, because
it was observed upon the <i>fiftieth day after the second
of the Passover</i>, which was the <i>sixteenth of Nisan</i>.
Here in the first place we must note, that the fourteenth
of <i>Nisan</i> was τὸ πάσχα, the <i>Passover</i>; the <i>fifteenth</i>
ἑορτὴ τοῦ πάσχα, the <i>Feast of the Passover</i>: or πρώτη τοῦ πάσχα,<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a>
the <i>first of the Passover</i>: the sixteenth was δευτέρα τοῦ πάσχα,
the <i>second of the Passover</i>; or <i>the morrow after the
Passover</i>, <i>Levit. 23. 11.</i> which is all one, as if it had
been said, the <i>morrow after the feast of the Passover</i>; for
in those feasts which consisted in many daies, the <i>first</i>
and the <i>last</i> were termed <i>Sabbaths</i>. Now these fifty
daies were in truth the appointed time of their Harvest,
their Harvest, being bounded as it were, with
two remarkable daies, the one being the <i>beginning</i>,
the other the <i>end</i> thereof: the <i>beginning</i> was δευτέρα
τοῦ πάσχα the <i>second of the Passover</i>; the <i>end</i> was πεντεκοστὴ,
the <i>fiftieth day after</i>, called the <i>Pentecost</i>. Upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
the δευτέρα, then they offered<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> a <i>sheaf of the same
fruits of their harvest</i>, <i>Levit. 23. 10.</i> Upon the <i>Pentecost</i>,
then they offered two <i>wave loavs</i>, <i>Levit. 23. 17.</i>
the <i>sheaf</i> being an Oblation offered in the name of the
whole Congregation, whereby all the after-fruits
throughout the Land were sanctified,<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> it being
from thence afterward lawful, and not before, to reap
the Corn, the <i>two loavs</i> being not only an <i>Eucharistical
Oblation</i>, but also a token of the Harvest finished
and ended. In the second place we are to know,
that they did count these fifty daies by numbring the
<i>Weeks</i> from the δευτέρα, whence it was called a <i>Feast of
weeks</i>. The manner how they counted the <i>weeks</i>,
was, according to the number of the <i>Sabbaths</i> following
the δευτέρα. Thus the first <i>Sabbath</i> following
they called δευτερόπρωτον σάββατον: the second, δευτεροδεύτερον:
the third δευτερότριτον, <i>&amp;c.</i> So that<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> all
the <i>Weeks</i> and <i>Sabbaths</i>, during the time of the <i>Pentecost</i>;
as the <i>first</i>, <i>second</i>, <i>third</i>, and <i>fourth</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> took
their denomination from δευτέρα, which observation
giveth light to that of S. <i>Luke</i>, <i>Luke 16. 1.</i> where
there is mention of a <i>Sabbath</i> termed δευτερόπρωτον,
that is, the <i>second first Sabbath</i>, and by it is meant
the <i>Sabbath next after the sixteenth of Nisan</i>, which
was the δευτέρα. Seeing that these <i>fifty daies</i> did measure
out the time of their Harvest, it will not be amiss
to observe the difference betwixt their Harvest and
ours, which chiefly consisted in their anticipation of
time; for both the <i>Canaanites</i> and the <i>Ægyptians</i> began
their Harvest about the first of <i>April</i>,<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> it was
quite finished in <i>May</i>.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>The Feast of Tabernacles</i></span></h3>

<p>The <i>Greek</i> word used to express this Festivity,
properly signifieth the <i>making of Tabernacles</i>:<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a>
the <i>Hebrew</i> word, a <i>Feast of Tabernacles</i>.<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a>
The reason of both is, because all the time of this
<i>Feast</i>, which was full seven daies, (from the fifteenth
of <i>Tisri</i>, untill the one and twentieth thereof) the
people remained in <i>Tabernacles</i> and <i>Booths</i> made of
Boughs, in manner of Arbors and Bowers; yet so,
that the first day of those seven, and the last, were
after a more special manner to be observed as <i>holy
Convocations</i>.</p>

<p>Concerning these Booths, the <i>Jews</i> write thus:<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>
They ought to be made in the open Air, not
within doors, nor under the shelter of a Tree; they
ought not to be covered with cloaths, nor to be
made too close with the thickness of the Boughs, but
with such holes that the Sun and the Stars might be
seen thorow them, and the rain likewise descend
thorow them. In these they ought to dwell those
seven days, as in their houses; they ought to furnish
them with houshold-stuff to ly under them, and sleep
under them; only in rainy weather, then they had
liberty to eat and sleep in their houses, untill the rain
was over-past. Feeble persons also, which could not
endure the smell of the earth, were permited to stay
at home. In <i>Nehemiah</i>’s time they made their Booths,
some upon the roof of their houses (for their houses
were made flat above) <i>Deut. 22. 8.</i> Some in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Courts, some in their streets, <i>Nehem. 8. 15.</i></p>

<p><i>Plutarch</i> making mention of this Festivity, saith,<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a>
that these <i>Booths</i> were made principally of Ivy
boughs: but the Scripture reckoneth up <i>four distinct
kinds</i>, <i>Levit. 23. 40.</i> which are thought to be, 1. <i>The
Cittern tree.</i> 2. <i>The Palm-tree.</i> 3. <i>The Myrtle tree.</i>
4. <i>The willow of the brook.</i> The <i>Rabbins</i> teach,<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> that
every man brought every morning his burden of the
boughs of these four Trees, otherwise he fasted that
day. And this burden they termed<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> <i>Hosanna</i>: in allusion
unto this the people cutting down branches
from the Trees, and strewing them in the way when
our <i>Saviour</i> did ride into <i>Jerusalem</i>, cried, saying, <i>Hosanna</i>
to the <i>Son of David</i>, <i>Mat. 21. 9.</i> <i>Plutarch</i> scoffing
the <i>Jews</i>, compares this Feast with that drunken
Festival in the honour of <i>Bacchus</i>, in which the <i>Bacchides</i>
ran up and down with certain Javelings in their
hands, wrapped about with Ivy, called θυρσοὶ and in
this respect he termeth this feast of the <i>Jews</i> θυρσοφορίαν
<i>A bearing about of these Thyrsi</i>. That feast which the
<i>Athenians</i> term Εἰρεσιώνη, was not much unlike.</p>

<p>Moreover on the next day after this feast, they
compassed the Altar<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> <i>seven times</i> with Palm-boughs
in their hands, in the remembrance of the

<p>Concerning the reason of this Feast; some are of opinion,
that it was instituted in memory of that protection
which the Lord vouchsafed the <i>Israelites</i> by
the Cloud, when they travelled thorow the Wilderness,
under the shadow of which they travelled, as under
a <i>safe Booth</i> or <i>Tent</i>. <i>Onkelos</i> in his <i>Chaldee Paraphrase</i>,
seemeth to incline to this opinion. Where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
<i>Hebrew</i> readeth; <i>That your posterity may know, that I
have made the children of Israel to dwell in Booths</i>, <i>Lev.
23. 43.</i> The <i>Chaldee</i> rendereth it, <i>That your posterity may
know that I have made the children of Israel to dwell
in the shadow of Clouds</i>.<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> Others think<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> it was instituted
as a solemn thanksgiving unto <i>God</i> for their
Vintage, which was gathered in at that time of the
year; thence it is that they conceive those Psalms of
<i>David</i>, which are entituled ‎‏על הגתית‏‎ <i>pro torcularibus</i>,
to have been composed for this feast. Others speak
more probably, who assign the cause to be in memory
of their Fore-fathers <i>dwelling in Tents and Tabernacles</i>;
the Text is clear, <i>Levit. 23. 43.</i></p>

<p>The Sacrifices which were offered these seven
daies, are prescribed: <i>Numb. 29.</i> from the thirteenth
verse to the thirty fourth, where we shall read every
day the like Sacrifice, but only with this difference,
that upon the first day they offered <i>thirteen</i> young
bullocks, upon the second <i>twelve</i>, upon the third <i>eleven</i>,
and so forward, ever diminishing the number by
one. The reason of which diminution, the <i>Jews</i>
deliver to be this:<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> the whole number of bullocks
to be offered at this solemnity was <i>seventy</i>, according
to the Languages of the <i>seventy Nations</i>, (for
whom, as they teach, these sacrifices were performed)
signifying thereby, that there should be a diminution
of those Nations, until all things were brought
under the government of the <i>Messias</i> who was the expectation
and Hope of the <i>Gentiles</i>.</p>

in truth a distinct feast, as appeareth, <i>Neh. 8. 18.</i> but
yet because this immediately followed the Feast of
<i>Tabernacles</i>, it hath been always counted the last day
of that Feast. And not only the <i>boughs</i>, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
<i>days</i> of this whole <i>feast of Tabernacles</i> were termed<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>
<i>Hosannoth</i>, from the usual acclamations of the
people, whiles they carried <i>Boughs</i> up and down.
And this eighth day was called <i>Hosanna Rabba</i>, the
<i>great Hosanna</i>, or the <i>great day of the feast</i>. <i>John 7. 37.</i>
Upon this day<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> they did read the last Section of
the Law, and likewise began the first, least they might
otherwise seem more joyful in ending their Sections,
than willing to begin them. Upon this day also,<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>
by the Institution of the Prophet <i>Haggæus</i> and <i>Zachary</i>,
and such like <i>Prophetical</i> men, they did with
great solemnity and joy, bring great store of water
from the River <i>Shiloah</i> to the Temple, where it being
delivered unto the <i>Priests</i>, it was poured upon the
Altar, together with Wine, and all the people sung
that of the <i>Prophet</i> <i>Esay. 12. 13.</i> <i>With joy shall ye draw
water out of the Wells of salvation</i>. Our Saviour is
thought to have alluded unto this, in that speech
which he used on this very day, <i>John 7. 38.</i> <i>He that
believeth in me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of waters
of life.</i></p>

<p>It is worth our noting also, that whereas God
commanded the Observation of this Feast on the fifteenth
of the seventh month <i>Tisri</i>; <i>Jeroboam</i>, that he
might work in the people a forgetfulness of the true
Worship of God, appointed<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> the celebration of a
Feast in the eighth month, on the fifteenth day thereof,
which is thought to be this very feast of <i>Tabernacles</i>.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the Feast of Trumpets, and their
New Moons.</i></span></h3>

<p>For the understanding of the time when this Feast
was to be observed, we must note, the month
<i>Tisri</i> was the <i>seventh month</i>, according to their
<i>sacred Computation</i>; and therefore it is commanded
to be celebrated the first day of the <i>seventh month</i>,
<i>Levit. 23. 24.</i> But according to their <i>Civil Computation</i>
it was their <i>first month</i>, so that this Feast may be
termed their <i>New-years-day</i>.</p>

<p>The first day of every month had its solemnities.
First, when they repaired to the <i>Prophets</i> for the hearing
of the word, as on other <i>Sabbaths</i>. Wherefore wilt
thou go to him to day? It is neither <i>New Moon</i>, nor
<i>Sabbath day</i>, <i>2 Kings 4. 23.</i> Secondly, It was then unlawful
to buy and sell: When will the <i>New Moon</i> be
gone, that we may sell corn? <i>Amos 8. 4.</i> Thirdly,
They had then special sacrifices over and above their
daily sacrifices.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding, this feast of <i>Trumpets</i> differed
from other <i>New Moons</i>. First, in respect of their sacrifices;
in their <i>ordinary New Moons</i> they offered (besides
the daily sacrifice) <i>two Bullocks, one Ram, seven
Lambs, for burnt-offerings</i>; with their meat and drink-offering,
and a <i>Goat for a sin-offering</i>, <i>Num. 28. 11, 15.</i>
But at this <i>New-Moon</i>, which was the beginning of
their year, they offered all the aforesaid sacrifices, and
over and besides them, <i>one Bullock, one Ram, and seven
Lambs, for burnt-offerings</i>, and a <i>Goat for a sin-offering,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
umb. 29. 1, 6.</i> Secondly, in <i>Other New Moons</i> they blowed
no <i>Trumpets</i>: In <i>this</i> they blowed<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> from the <i>Sun
rising till night</i>: whence we learn what <i>New Moon</i> it
is that <i>David</i> speaketh of, <i>Psal. 81. 3.</i> <i>Blow the Trumpet
in the New Moon, in the time appointed, at our feast day.</i></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_342" id="Footnote_342"></a><a href="#FNanchor_342"><span class="label">[342]</span></a> <i>Sheindler, in
voce ‎‏שפר‏‎</i></p>

</div>

<p>The reason in general of this blowing, and great
<i>noise of Trumpets</i>, I take to have been, to make their
<i>New-years-day</i> the more remarkable, because from it
all their deeds and contracts bore date, and their
<i>Sabbatical years</i> and <i>Jubilees</i> were counted thence:
But why it should be made remarkable by the
sound of <i>Trumpets</i>, or <i>Cornets</i>, there are three conjectures.</p>

<p><i>First</i>, the <i>Hebrews</i> think<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> it was done in memory
of <i>Isaac</i> his deliverance, and that they did therefore
sound <i>Rams horns</i>, because a <i>Ram</i> was sacrificed
instead of him. <i>Secondly</i>, <i>Basil</i><a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> is of opinion, that
the people were hereby put in mind of that day,
wherein they received the Law in Mount <i>Sinai</i> with
<i>blowing of Trumpets</i>. <i>Thirdly</i>, others think it was to
put them in rememberance of the <i>Resurrection</i>, which
shall be with the <i>sound of Trumpets</i>; <i>He shall send his
Angels with a great sound of a Trumpet</i>, <i>Mat. 24. 31.</i></p>

</div>

<p>There are three things considerable in <i>New
Moons</i>.<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> <i>First</i>, σύνοδος, the <i>conjunction of the Moon
with the Sun</i>. <i>Secondly</i>, ἐξαυγασμὸς, the <i>waxing of the
Moon</i>. <i>Thirdly</i>, σχῆμα μηνοειδὲς, the <i>prime of the
Moon</i>. In the first it was <i>quite dark</i>; in the second it
<i>did open it self to receive the Sun-beams</i>: In the last it
did appear, <i>corniculata</i>, <i>horned</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>Because in all these three degrees of the change,
there was a kind of mutual participation both of
the <i>Old and New Moon</i>: Hence the <i>Jews</i> observe
two daies,<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> namely, the <i>last of every moneth</i>, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
<i>first day of the next following</i>. Now because the <i>thirtieth</i>
was the last in their longest months; Hence <i>Horace</i>
calleth these <i>last days</i>, <i>Tricesima Sabbata</i>: The
<i>first days</i> they termed, <i>Neomenias</i>, <i>new Moons</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<p>For certain reasons the <i>Jews</i> used a kind of
change, or <i>translation</i> of daies; which <i>translation</i>,
though it were of use in other months also, yet the
greatest care was had in translating the beginning of
their year, or their first day in their month <i>Tisri</i>;
and he that shall diligently calculate these changes,
shall find, that all other translations depended on this
first.</p>

<p><i>Translation of daies</i> was threefold.<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> <i>First</i>, <i>Lunary</i>:
<i>Secondly</i>, <i>Politik</i>: <i>Thirdly</i>, <i>Mixt</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_347" id="Footnote_347"></a><a href="#FNanchor_347"><span class="label">[347]</span></a> <i>Scalig. de emend.
temp. l. 2.
p. 85.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The reason of <i>Lunary translation</i>, was, that they
might not observe the Feast of the <i>New Moon</i>, until
the old were quite over-past. For the understanding
of this, note these three rules.</p>

<p>First, The <i>Hebrews</i> counted their Holy-daies from
night to night, beginning at six of the clock; so that
from six of the clock the first night, till the next noon,
were just eighteen hours.</p>

<p>Secondly, Always before the <i>New Moon</i>, there is
a <i>conjunction</i> between the <i>Sun</i> and the <i>Moon</i>; during
this <i>conjunction</i> she is called <i>Luna silens</i>, by reason of
her darkness, and all this time there is a participation
of the <i>New Moon</i>.</p>

<p>Thirdly, When the conjunction was over past before
noon-tide, namely, in any of those first 18 hours,
then the <i>New Moon</i> was celebrated the same day.<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>
But if it continued but one minute after twelve of
the clock at noon, then the feast was <i>translated</i> to the
day following, because otherwise they should begin
their Holy-day in the time of the old Moon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
And this translation they noted with this abbreviation ‎‏יה‏‎,
that is, 18, because of those eighteen hours
which occasioned it.</p>

Heb. p. 46.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The reason of <i>Politick translation</i>, was, that two
<i>Sabbaths</i>, or feast-days might not immediately follow
each other: because say they,<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> it was unlawful
those two daies to dress meat, or bury the dead; and
it was likewise inconvenient to keep meat dressed, or
the dead unburied two daies. Yet here two exceptions
must be remembred, when the meeting of two
Sabbaths could not be avoided.</p>

</div>

<p>First, When the <i>Passover</i>, or the fifteenth day of
<i>Nisan</i>, fell on <i>Saturday</i>; for then the <i>Pentecost</i> must
needs fall on <i>Sunday</i>.</p>

<p>Secondly, When the <i>Passover</i> fell on <i>Sunday</i>; for
then their <i>Passover</i> immediately followed their <i>weekly
Sabbath</i>.</p>

<p>The first Author of this <i>Politick translation</i> was
a certain chief man amongst them, named <i>Eleazar</i>;<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a>
three hundred and fifty years before <i>Christ</i> his <i>Nativity</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>The several species or kinds of <i>Politick translation</i>,
were five. The first, ‎‏אדו‏‎ <i>Adu</i>. The second, ‎‏בדו‏‎ <i>Badu</i>.
The third, ‎‏גהז‏‎ <i>Gahaz</i>. The fourth, ‎‏זבד‏‎ <i>Zabad</i>. The
fifth, ‎‏אגו‏‎ <i>Agu</i>. For the understanding of these abbreviatures,
we must know, that in these made words
the letters only stand for numbers, and are applied
to the seven daies of the week, thus ‎‏א‏‎ 1. <i>Sunday</i>. ‎‏ב‏‎
2. <i>Munday</i>. ‎‏ג‏‎ 3. <i>Tuesday</i>. ‎‏ד‏‎ 4. <i>Wednesday</i>. ‎‏ה‏‎ 5. <i>Thursday</i>.
‎‏ו‏‎ 6. <i>Friday</i>. ‎‏ז‏‎ 7. <i>Saturday</i>: which was the <i>Jews
Sabbath</i>.</p>

<p>Their rules touching <i>Politick translation</i>, stood
thus.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> First, that neither their <i>New-years-day</i>,
which was the first of the month <i>Tisri</i>, neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
their <i>Feast of Tabernacles</i>, which was the fifteenth day
of the same month, should be celebrated on <i>Adu</i>,
that is on <i>Sunday</i>, or <i>Wednesday</i>, or <i>Friday</i>. Not on
<i>Sunday</i>, or <i>Friday</i>, because then the <i>weekly Sabbath</i>
must needs concur with it, either going immediately
before, or following after: not on <i>Wednesday</i>, because
then the <i>Feast of expiation</i>, which is the tenth of that
month, would fall on <i>Friday</i> the day going immediately
before their <i>weekly Sabbath</i>. This instance
is only concerning the first of <i>Tisri</i>, which is
called the <i>Feast of Trumpets</i>: but it holdeth also, by
way of consequence, in the <i>fifteenth day</i>, which is the
<i>Feast of Tabernacles</i>, because the fifteenth must always
necessarily be of the same day of the week
that the first is. Therefore if the first be not <i>Adu</i>, the
fifteenth cannot be <i>Adu</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_351" id="Footnote_351"></a><a href="#FNanchor_351"><span class="label">[351]</span></a> <i>Adu.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The second rule was,<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> that the <i>Passover</i> should
not be observed on <i>Badu</i>; that is on <i>Munday</i>, <i>Wednesday</i>,
or <i>Friday</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_352" id="Footnote_352"></a><a href="#FNanchor_352"><span class="label">[352]</span></a> <i>Badu.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The third rule is,<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> that <i>Pentecost</i> was not observed
on <i>Gahaz</i>; that is, on <i>Tuesday</i>, <i>Thursday</i>, or <i>Saturday</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_353" id="Footnote_353"></a><a href="#FNanchor_353"><span class="label">[353]</span></a> <i>Gahaz.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The fourth rule is,<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> that the <i>Feast of Purim</i>, or
<i>casting lots</i>, was not observed on <i>Zabad</i>, that is, on
<i>Munday</i>, <i>Wednesday</i>, or <i>Saturday</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_354" id="Footnote_354"></a><a href="#FNanchor_354"><span class="label">[354]</span></a> <i>Zabad.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The fifth rule is,<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> that the <i>Feast of expiation</i> was
not observed on <i>Agu</i>; that is, on <i>Sunday</i>, <i>Tuesday</i>, or
<i>Friday</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_355" id="Footnote_355"></a><a href="#FNanchor_355"><span class="label">[355]</span></a> <i>Agu.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Mixt translation</i> is, when both the <i>Lunary</i> and the
<i>Politick</i> meet in the changing of daies. And the <i>translation</i>
occasioned by this mixture or meeting of both
these two, is twofold. First, <i>Simple</i>. And secondly,
<i>Double</i>.</p>

<p><i>Simple translation</i> is, when the Feast is translated to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the next day following. For examples sake, If the
<i>Moon</i> changed after noon-tide on <i>Sunday</i>, here the
<i>Feast</i> must be translated, for two reasons: the first is
<i>Lunary</i>, because the point of the change was after
<i>eighteen hours</i>; the second, <i>Politick</i>, because the rule
<i>Adu</i> forbids <i>Sunday</i> to be kept: notwithstanding, in
as much as the very next day, namely <i>Munday</i>, was observed;
I term this translation <i>simple</i>. Of this sort was
that translation which they called <i>Batu takphat</i>.</p>

<p>‎‏בטו תקפט‏‎ <i>Batu Takphat</i>,<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> is a word invented for
help of memory; each letter is a numeral, and may be
thus resolved, ‎‏ב‏‎ 2. ‎‏טו‏‎ 15. ‎‏תקפט‏‎ 589. The meaning is, that
in the year following <i>Annum Embolymæum</i> (wherein
one whole month was ingrafted) if the point of the
change happened upon the second day of the week,
that is, <i>Munday</i> not before the fifteenth hour, and
the 589 moment, the Feast of the <i>New Moon</i> was
<i>translated unto Tuesday</i>. How both the <i>Lunary</i> and <i>Politick</i>
translation work in this change, read <i>Scaliger,
de emend. temp. lib. 2. pag. 87</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_356" id="Footnote_356"></a><a href="#FNanchor_356"><span class="label">[356]</span></a> <i>Batu takphat.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Double Translation</i>, is, when the Feast is translated
not to the next, but to some further day: as if the first
day of the month <i>Tisri</i> should happen upon <i>Saturday</i>;
here, if the Moon hath not overpast her conjunction
before the afternoon, <i>Lunary translation</i> removeth
this <i>Feast</i> till <i>Sunday</i>, because of ‎‏יח‏‎, that is, the
<i>eighteen hours</i>: <i>Politick translation</i> removeth it till
<i>Munday</i>, as appeareth by the rule <i>Adu</i>, forbidding
<i>Sunday</i>; of this sort is <i>Gatrad</i>.</p>

<p>‎‏גטרד‏‎ <i>Gatrad</i>, is a made word, each letter is a numeral,
and it may be thus resolved, ‎‏ג‏‎ 3. ‎‏ט‏‎ 9. ‎‏רד‏‎ 204. The
meaning thereof is thus: In their common year
(when a whole month is not inserted) if the point
of the change happen upon the <i>third day</i> of the week,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
that is, <i>Tuesday</i>, not before the ninth hour, and the
204 moment of an hour, then the <i>New Moon</i> shall be
translated to <i>Thursday</i>.</p>

<p>Note in the last place, that 1080 <i>moments</i>
make an <i>hour</i>.<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Feast of Tabernacles</i> was observed in the month
<i>Tisri</i>, and therefore that could not be observed
the morrow after the <i>Sabbath</i>, as appeareth by the
rule <i>Adu</i>. The <i>Passover</i> was observed in the month
<i>Nisan</i>, and therefore that might be observed the morrow
after the <i>Sabbath</i>, as appeareth by the rule <i>Badu</i>.
If any ask the reason why the <i>Passover</i> might be observed
the next day after the <i>Sabbath</i>, seeing the
<i>Feast of Tabernacles</i> might not? I take it to be thus;
All the <i>after translations</i> depended upon the <i>first translation</i>
of the <i>first New Moon in Tisri</i>; but that could
not be so changed, as to prevent all concurrence of
two <i>Feasts</i>; and thus to have their <i>Passover</i> sometimes
to follow their <i>Sabbath</i>, they thought the most convenientest
ordering of the year, because though not
all meetings of two <i>Sabbaths</i>, yet most were hereby
prevented.</p>

<p>This tract of translation of Feasts, it serveth partly
to open the customs of the <i>Jews</i>: partly to give
light for the understanding of that great dispute among
<i>Divines</i>, whether our <i>Saviour</i> did anticipate
the <i>Passover</i>. The <i>Greek Church</i> holds,<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> that he kept a
<i>Passover</i> by himself with his <i>Disciples</i>, on the thirteenth
day of the month, when <i>unleavened bread</i> was
not yet to be used; and thence they do both use and
urge a necessity<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> of <i>leavened bread in the Lords supper</i>:
But this opinion we reject. First, because it accordeth
not with the truth of <i>Evangelical History</i>. Secondly,
because it plainly maketh <i>Christ</i> to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
transgressor, not a fulfiller of the Law. Others say,<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> that
because that year their <i>Passover</i> fell on <i>Friday</i>, hence
the feast was translated unto <i>Saturday</i> by the rule <i>Badu</i>.
Their inference is that <i>Christ</i> kept the fourteenth
day of the month, which was <i>Friday</i>, and the <i>Jews</i>
kept <i>Saturday</i>. He kept Gods Command, they the
<i>tradition of the Elders</i>. Lastly, others more probably
hold,<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> that both <i>Christ</i> and the <i>Jews</i> did eat the
<i>Passover</i> the same day and hour; namely, on <i>Friday</i>,
or the fourteenth day of the month, if we count the
beginning of <i>Friday</i> according to the manner of the
<i>Jews</i>, from six a clock at night on <i>Thursday</i>. <i>Friday</i>
morning he was judged, and crucified; and in the afternoon,
about three of the clock, when the <i>preparation
of the Sabbath</i> began, he was buried; <i>There laid

<p>For reconciling the <i>Evangelists</i> in this point, we
must note these particulars, which are more at large
proved in the <i>Chapter of the Passover</i>. 1. The <i>fourteenth</i>
day of the month, on which the <i>Paschal Lamb</i>
was eaten, was called the first day of <i>unleavened
bread</i>; the Feast of <i>unleavened bread</i> drew near, which
is called the <i>Passover</i>, <i>Luke 22. 1.</i></p>

<p>The <i>fourteenth</i> day was not holy, but the <i>fifteenth</i>
was. In the <i>fourteenth</i> day of the first month is the
<i>Passover</i> of the <i>Lord</i>, and in the <i>fifteenth</i> day of this
month is the Feast, <i>Numb. 28. 16, 17.</i> Some of them
thought, because <i>Judas</i> had the bag, that <i>Jesus</i> had said
unto him, Buy those things that we have need of against
the Feast, <i>John 13. 29.</i></p>

<p>The <i>Sheep and Bullocks</i> offered upon this day, are
called the <i>Passover</i>, <i>Deut. 16. 2.</i> And of this we are
to understand S. <i>John</i>, <i>Joh. 18. 28.</i> They themselves
went not into the common Hall, lest they should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
defiled, but that they might eat the <i>Passover</i>. So that
this eating of the <i>Passover</i> is not understood of the
<i>Paschal Lamb</i>. But some may question, How they
should have been defiled by entring into the common
Hall? The answer is,<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> that upon <i>Holy-day-eves</i>,
which they termed <i>days of preparation</i>, they held it
unlawful for their <i>Judges to sit on life and death</i>. Hence
it is that they brought <i>Jesus to Pilate</i> the <i>Roman
Deputy</i>. <i>Secondly</i>, they withdrew themselves out of the
common Hall. <i>Thirdly</i>, for this reason they said, <i>It is
not lawful for us to put any man to death</i>, <i>Joh. 18. 31.</i>
that is, upon this, or such like day;<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> for though their
high Court of <i>Sanedrim</i> were put down at this time,
yet all power in cases of life and death was not taken
from them, as is implied in the words following; It
was that the word of <i>Jesus</i> might be fulfilled, which
he spake signifying what death he should die, <i>ver. 32.</i>
Which text intimateth, that that unlawfulness was
urged by the special providence of God, that he
might be crucified, being judged by <i>Pilat</i>: for if the
<i>Jews</i> had judged, they used no such kind of death towards
Malefactors. Again, <i>Stephen</i> was condemned
by them to be stoned, <i>Act. 7.</i> And they complained
before <i>Felix</i>, that when they were about to proceed
against <i>Paul</i> according to their own Law, the chief
Captain <i>Lysias</i> with violence took him out of their
hands, <i>Acts 24.</i> Which argueth, that all power in
causes capital was not taken from them: But of this
see the <i>Chapter, Of their capital punishments</i>.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>The Feast of Expiation.</i></span></h3>

<p>Upon the tenth day of the month <i>Tisri</i>, answering
to <i>September</i> with us, the <i>Feast of Expiation</i>
was commanded to be celebrated, <i>Levit. 13.</i> It was
called the <i>Feast of Expiation</i>, because the <i>High-priest</i>
did then confess unto <i>God</i> both his own sins, and the
sins of the people: and by the performance of certain
Rites and Ceremonies expiate them, and make an
attonement unto <i>God</i> for them.</p>

<p>The <i>Ceremonies</i> at this time to be performed, concerned
either the <i>People</i> and the <i>Priest</i>, or the <i>Priest alone</i>.
Those which concerned the <i>People and the Priest</i>,
consisted in the afflicting of their souls by <i>fasting</i>.
Whence this Feast was also called<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> <i>Dies Jejunii</i>, <i>the
Fasting Day</i>, <i>Jer. 36. 6.</i> Which serveth for the understanding
of that, <i>Act. 27. 9.</i> <i>Sailing was now dangerous,
because the Feast was already past</i>; that is, the <i>Feast of
Expiation</i> was now past, and Winter was at hand.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_364" id="Footnote_364"></a><a href="#FNanchor_364"><span class="label">[364]</span></a> <i>Joseph. de bel. Jud. pag. 43.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Those <i>Ceremonies</i> which concerned the <i>Priest alone</i>,
were two: First, then the <i>High-priest</i> entred into
the <i>Holiest of Holies</i>, which was peculiar unto this
day. Secondly, he being about to sacrifice for himself
and his house, he took unto him a <i>young Bullock for a
sin-offering, and a Ram for a burnt offering</i>, putting
on his Priestly Robes: After he had washed himself
in water; he took of the Congregation <i>two He-goats
for a sin-offering, and a Ram for a burnt offering</i>. The
<i>two He-goats</i> he presented before the <i>Lord</i> at the
door of the <i>Tabernacle</i>, casting lots which of them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
should be sacrificed, which let <i>scape alive</i>. This last
was termed<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> the <i>scape Goat</i>, because the other being
slain, this was sent alive into the Wilderness. The
Greek Interpreters call this Goat ἀποπομπαῖον, <i>Malorum
depulsorem</i>, <i>A defender from evils</i>; which name
the Heathens applied to their <i>Tutelar Gods</i>. They intimated,
that when the <i>scape Goat</i> carried away the
sins of the people into the Wilderness, he likewise
carried away all those <i>evils</i> which belonged unto
those sins. And for the securing the people in this
point, the <i>Lord</i> commanded the <i>High priest</i> to confess
in the name of all the people, and to disburden the
sins of the whole Congregation upon the head of the
<i>scape Goat</i>. The form of <i>Confession</i>, according to the
relation of the <i>Hebrew Doctors</i>, was this:<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> <i>O Lord,
thy People, the House of Israel, they have sinned, they
have done wickedly, they have transgressed before thee; I
beseech thee now, O Lord, pardon the sins, iniquities, and
transgressions, with which the People, the House of Israel
have sinned, done wickedly, and transgressed before thee,
as it is written in the Law of thy servant</i> Moses: <i>that
in that day he shall make Attonement for you, that he
might cleanse you, and that you might be clean from all
your iniquities before the Lord.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The <i>modern Jews</i> now (because there can be no
proper sacrifice, the <i>Temple</i> of <i>Jerusalem</i> being destroyèd)
the men they take a <i>white Cock</i> on this day,
the women a <i>Hen</i>.<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> This <i>Cock</i> they swing three
times about the <i>Priests</i> head, saying, <i>Gallus Gallinaceus
hic commutatio erit pro me</i>: that is, <i>This Cock shall
be a propitiation for me</i>. After that they kill the <i>Cock</i>;
acknowledging themselves worthy of death; and
then they cast the intrals upon the top of the house,
that some Raven or Crow might carry both them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
and together with them, their sins into the Wilderness.
And least they might seem to be mad without
reason, they assign the cause why they make choice
of a <i>Cock</i>, at this time, to be this: This word<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> <i>Gebher</i>
in the Holy Language signifieth a Man, in their
<i>Talmud</i> it signifieth a Cock. Now, say they, the Justice
of <i>God</i> requires, that as <i>Gebher</i> sinned, so <i>Gebher</i>
should make satisfaction. From this <i>Feast of Expiation</i>
it is probable, that the <i>Grecians</i> used a yearly <i>Expiation</i>
of their Cities, which was performed on this
manner: Certain condemned persons were brought
forth with Garlands upon their heads, in manner of
sacrifices, these they would tumble from some steep
place into the Sea, offering them up to <i>Neptune</i>,
using this form of words,<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> περίψημα ἡμῶν γενοῦ, <i>Sis pro nobis
peripsema</i>: As if he had said, <i>Be thou a Reconciliation or
Propitiation for us</i>. The like kind of Expiation was used
among them in time of any Pestilence, or contagious
infection; for removal of such diseases, they then sacrificed
certain men unto their <i>Gods</i>, such men they
termed καθάρματα.<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> These two words are used by the
<i>Apostle</i>, <i>1 Cor. 4. 13.</i> and they are translated <i>filth and
off-scouring</i>: We are made as the <i>filth of the World, and
as the off-scouring of all things</i>. The words signifie properly
the <i>filth or dirt scraped off mens shooes</i>, or from
the <i>pavement of the ground</i>: But in <i>Budæus</i> his
opinion,<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> the <i>Apostle</i> had allusion unto those kinds of
Expiations in use amongst the <i>Heathens</i>. As if he had
said, We are as despicable and as odious in the sight
of the people, as much loaded with the revilings and
cursings of the multitude, as those condemned persons,
who were offered up by way of publick Expiation.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>The Sabbatical year, or Seventh
years rest</i></span></h3>

<p>As every seventh day was a <i>Sabbath day</i>, so every
seventh year was a <i>Sabbatical year</i>, <i>Levit. 25.</i>
And as the <i>Sabbath day</i> signified that they themselves
were the <i>Lords</i>, and therefore they abstained from
their own work to do the <i>Lords</i>: So the <i>Sabbatical
year</i> was to signifie, that both they and their land was
the <i>Lords</i>.</p>

<p>The observation of this Feast consisted chiefly in
two things. First, in the not tilling or manuring of
their ground, whence it was called <i>Scabath Haarets</i>,<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>
the <i>Sabbaths of the Land</i>, <i>Levit. 25. 6.</i> Secondly, in
the Creditors discharging their debtors, and releasing
their debts, and thence it was called <i>Shemita
laihova</i>,<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> <i>The Lords release</i>, <i>Deut. 15. 2.</i></p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<p>Seeing they were that year forbid to till their
ground, here a question might be made; what they
should eat in the time of this intermission?</p>

<p>Answ. <i>I will command my blessing upon you in the
sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years</i>,
<i>Levit. 25. 20, 21.</i> saith the Lord.</p>

<p>Seeing every seventh year, debts, according to
Gods Command were to be remitted, some might demand
whether this might not much endamage their
Estates if they did lend? or harden their hearts not to
lend?</p>

<p><i>Answ.</i> It could not endamage their Estates, for it
is a most infallible <i>Maxime</i>: <i>No man is a loser by serving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
God</i>. Whence the <i>Hebrews</i> themselves interpret
this to be rather <i>Mandatum probationis</i>, <i>A command
of tryal</i>, such as <i>Abrahams</i> offering up of <i>Isaac</i> was,
which <i>God</i> commanded, not intending that he
should be sacrificed, but that <i>Abrahams</i> love might be
tryed; rather than <i>Mandatum obedientiæ</i>, <i>A command
of obedience</i>. To this purpose speaketh <i>Aben Ezra</i>, interpreting
these words, <i>Save when there shall be no poor
among you</i>. <i>Deut. 15. 4.</i> That is, saith he,<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> as if the
<i>Lord</i> had said, <i>Know that that which I have commanded
thee, that thou shouldest not exact of thy Brother,
will be needless. If all Israel, or the greater part obey
the voice of God, then there shall be no poor amongst
you, to whom it shall be needful for thee to lend; yea, all of
you shall be able to lend to many Nations.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The reasons why this Feast was instituted, are
thought to be: First, to teach the people to depend
upon <i>Gods</i> providence by faith; for though the owner
of the field might gather, even on that year, for
the maintenance of himself and his family, <i>Levit.
25. 6.</i> yet he was neither to sow his field, thereby
to make his Harvest the greater; nor to hedge his
field, or lock up his Corn-yard, thereby to enjoy
the propriety, but to let all be common, and every
mans hand equal in every place. Secondly, they were
hereby put in mind of that happy estate which <i>Adam</i>
enjoyed in his Innocency, when the earth brought
forth her encrease without manuring. Lastly, it
shadowed forth that <i>everlasting Sabbath</i> which we
expect in the Heavens. And some conjecture<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a>
this to be the ground of <i>Rabbi Elias</i> his opinion,<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a>
that the <i>world should continue for six thousand years,
but the seventh thousand should be the <span class="antiqua">great</span> Sabbatical
year</i>. The six thousand years answered the six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
working daies of the week, the seventh answered
our Sabbath, according to that, A thousand years are
but as one day with the Lord, <i>2 Pet. 3. 8.</i> <i>Elias</i> his
words are these; <i>Six thousand years the world shall be,
and again it shall be destroyed: Two thousand shall be
void, two thousand under the Law, and two thousand under
the Messias.</i><a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> The substance of this Prophecy, howsoever
we reject it as too curious, yet seeing that a <i>Jew</i>
spake it, it may serve to prove against them: First,
That the <i>Messias</i> is already come: Secondly, That
<i>Moses</i> his Law ceased at his coming.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of their Jubilee.</i></span></h3>

<p>This is the last Festival which <i>God</i> commanded
the <i>Jews</i>, it was celebrated every <i>fiftieth year</i>. It
is commanded, <i>Lev. 25. 8.</i> Thou shalt number seven
<i>Sabbaths</i> of years unto thee, <i>&amp;c.</i> The <i>English</i> word
<i>Jubilee</i> is derived from the <i>Hebrew</i> ‎‏יובל‏‎ <i>Jobel</i>, signifying
a <i>Ram</i>; it signifieth a <i>Rams horn</i>. Seven <i>Priests</i>
shall bear before the <i>Ark</i> seven <i>Trumpets of Rams
horns</i>, <i>Josh. 6. 4.</i> Where the word <i>Jobelim</i> is used, and
is expounded by the <i>Chaldee Paraphrast</i>, <i>Rams-horns</i>.
<i>Marbachius</i> is of opinion, that this year was called
their <i>Jubilee</i>, from <i>Jubal</i>,<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> the first inventer of musical
instruments, of whom we read, <i>Gen. 4. 21.</i> <i>Jubal
was the Father of all such as handle the Harp and Organ</i>.
Other Authors deliver other reasons of the name, but
it is most probable that this year was termed the year
of <i>Jubilee</i> from <i>Jobelim</i>, the <i>Rams-horns</i> then sounded.
There were five main uses of this Feast.</p>

<p>First, for the general release of Servants. Secondly,
for the restoring of Lands and Tenements unto their
first Owners, who formerly sold them. Thirdly,
hereby a true distinction of their Tribes was preserved,
because Lands returned unto their Owners in
their proper Tribe, and Servants to their own <i>Families</i>.
Fourthly, some are of opinion,<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> that as the
<i>Grecians</i> did compute their times by the number of
<i>Olympiads</i>, the <i>Romans</i> by their <i>Lustra</i>, the <i>Christians</i>
by their <i>Indictions</i>: So the <i>Jews</i> by their <i>Jubilees</i>.
Lastly, it did mystically shadow forth that spiritual
<i>Jubilee</i>, which <i>Christians</i> enjoy under <i>Christ</i>, by whose
blood we have not only a re-entry into the <i>Kingdom
of Heaven</i>, which we had formerly forfeited by our
sins (and this was haply signified by the <i>Israelites</i> re-entry
upon their Lands formerly sold) but also the
<i>sound of the Gospel</i>, which was in this Feast typed out
unto us by the <i>noise of the Trumpets</i>, is gone thorowout
the world. And thus the <i>Lord God hath blown the
Trumpet</i>, as <i>Zacharies</i> phrase is, <i>Zach. 9. 14.</i> But neither
this release of servants, nor restoring of Lands,
was until the tenth day of the first month <i>Tisri</i>,<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a>
at which time it was proclaimed by the sound of
Trumpets, or Rams horns; the nine first daies of
this month the Servants feasted and made merry,
and wore Garlands, in token of their liberty approaching.</p>

or Dedication.</i></span></h3>

<p><i>Pur</i> is a <i>Persian</i> word, and signifieth a Lot, whence
this <i>Feast of Lots</i> is called <i>Purim</i>, i.e. κληρωτήρια, <i>A
Lottery</i>: It began on the fourteenth of <i>Adar</i>, and
continued till the end of the fifteenth, <i>Esth. 9. 21.</i> It
was instituted by <i>Mordecai</i>, in remembrance of the
<i>Jews</i> delivery from <i>Haman</i>, before whom lots were
cast day by day, and month by month, for the destruction
of them. In these two daies they read the
History of <i>Hester</i> in their <i>Synagogues</i>; and as often as
they hear mention of <i>Haman</i>, they do with their
fists and hammers beat upon the benches and boards,
as if they did knock upon <i>Hamans</i> head.<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p>

<p>The Feast of <i>Dedication</i>, termed in the <i>New Testament</i>,
Ἐγκαίνια<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> a Feast wherein something is renewed;
because those things only are reputed consecrated,
which are separated from their common
use, and dedicated to some new and holy use. We
shall read of many <i>things consecrated</i> in the <i>Old Testament</i>;
the <i>Tabernacles</i>, the <i>Temple</i>, <i>Priests</i>, <i>Altars</i>,
<i>Vessels</i> and <i>Garments</i>: but there was no anniversary
or yearly solemnity appointed to be observed in remembrance
of their <i>Consecration</i>. The <i>Consecration</i>
therefore which we now speak of, being a yearly
Festival, was the <i>Consecration of the altar appointed by
Judas Maccabæus</i> to be observed from year to year,
for the space of eight days, from the five and twentieth
of the month <i>Cisleu</i>, which answereth in part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
to our <i>December</i>, <i>1 Macchab. 4. 59.</i> Of this Saint
<i>John</i> speaketh; and as he mentioneth our <i>Saviours</i>
presence there, so he intimateth the time to be about
<i>December</i>. <i>It was at Jerusalem the feast of the Dedication,
and it was winter</i>, <i>John 10. 22. &amp;c.</i></p>

<p>The reason of this Feast was in remembrance of
that great mercy which God shewed unto his people,
in delivering them from the tyranny of <i>Antiochus</i>,
and the <i>Idolatry</i> which he had forced upon
them, setting up the <i>Idol of Jupiter</i> in the <i>Temple of
God</i>, and abolishing the true worship of <i>God</i>.</p>

<p>These two <i>Feasts</i> are of <i>humane institution</i>, and others
might be added unto them; but little is to be
added, or nothing at all, to that which is delivered
concerning them, in the places of Scripture where
they are mentioned.</p>

<p>The Infiniteness of <i>Gods</i> Majesty far transcendeth
the capacity of created Natures; and
if we consult not with <i>Gods</i> own <i>Oracles</i>,
though the sense of a <i>Deity</i> may be imprinted even in
an <i>Atheists</i> heart, yet so far shall he be from all right
understanding of <i>God</i>, that he will adore the <i>creature</i>
instead of the <i>Creator</i>: and when he hath multiplied
the number of his <i>gods</i>, according to the number of
the Stars in heaven, and creeping things on earth;
yet still his heart will be doubtful, whether he hath
worshipped the true <i>God</i>, nay whether the true God
be not utterly unknown. For this reason the Marriners
in <i>Jonahs</i> ship cried every man unto his <i>God</i>, <i>Jonah
1. 5.</i> Every man to his <i>own God</i>; and lest they
might all mistake the <i>true God</i>, they awaken <i>Jonah</i>
to call upon <i>his God</i>. This uncertainty<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> attending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
<i>Idolatry</i>, caused the <i>Heathens</i> to close their Petitions
with that general, <i>Dii deæque omnes</i>.<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> The <i>Arabians</i>
perceiving the insufficiency of their <i>known Gods</i>,
dedicated their <i>Altars</i>, <i>Ignoto Deo</i>, <i>To the unknown God</i>.
At <i>Athens</i>, Saint <i>Paul</i> found an Altar with the same
inscription, <i>Acts 17. 23.</i> Hence other Neighbour-Countries
were wont to swear<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> <i>by him that was
unknown at Athens</i>. From this doubt and distrust among
the <i>Athenians</i>, what <i>God</i> was, and who he
was, sprang another uncertainty amongst them, as
dangerous as the other, dividing and sharing that
undividable Unity of the <i>Godhead</i>, between I know
not what Compeers and Equals, so that they had other
Altars mentioning a plurality of gods:<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> the
inscription being θεῶν ἀγνώστων, <i>the Altar of the unknown
Gods</i>, yea, the compleat and entire inscription of that
Altar which Saint <i>Paul</i> saw, is thought to have been
thus,<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> <i>To the gods of <span class="antiqua">Asia</span>, <span class="antiqua">Europe</span>, and <span class="antiqua">Africa</span>; to the
unknown and strange, God</i>. Which observation implieth
their practice to have symbolized with other
<i>Heathens</i> in that forementioned closure; <i>Dii Deæque
omnes</i>, <i>O all ye Gods and Godesses, help</i>. This distrust
I think to be the chief reason why they worshipped
the <i>unknown God</i>; though I deny not but the Altars
might bear this Title, to conceal the name of their
<i>Tutelar God</i>, unto whose protection they had committed
themselves: because the <i>Heathen</i> people
generally conceited,<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> that if the <i>gods</i> name, to whom
they dedicated a City, were known, then the Enemies
might by some magical incantation or charm,
call him forth, and cause him to foresake the City:
For the better preventing of which manner of evocations,
the <i>Tyrians</i>, the <i>Lacedemonians</i>, and other
Nations<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> fettered and chained their <i>gods</i>, that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
might not depart. Again, it might be done in imitation
of the <i>Jews</i>, who about the time of our <i>Saviour</i>
his Incarnation, held it unlawful to pronounce that
Essential Name of God, <i>Jehovah</i>, and instead thereof
would read <i>Adonai</i>. The occasion of this concealment
of the name <i>Jehovah</i>, I take to have been originally,
to prevent the blaspheming of that holy
Name among the <i>Heathens</i>, who had learned from
that name to denominate their <i>Idols</i>, <i>Jove</i> Ἰαὼ <i>Iaoth</i>,
Ἰαώια, <i>&amp;c.</i><a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> Hence afterward the forbearing the
Name became superstitious, and so far prevailed,
that they corrupted the Text for the defence thereof,
<i>Ex. 3. 15.</i> This is my name ‎‏לעולם‏‎ <i>legnolam</i>, <i>for
ever</i>: they read ‎‏לעלם‏‎ <i>legnalem</i>, <i>to be concealed</i>.<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a>
Though I deny not but that name was always in
some sense ineffable: namely, as <i>Pliny</i> saith,<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> the
names of the <i>African</i> people and Towns were ineffable,
that is, such as other Languages could not express
without circumlocutions.</p>

<p>As those forementioned <i>Idolatrous</i> names were
nothing else but so many depravations of the name
<i>Jehovah</i>: so the Original of many other ensuing
kinds of <i>Idolatry</i> proceeded at first from a misconstruction
of Scripture. They have learned by
Tradition, that the Sun, Moon, and Stars, had a kind
of Lordship and rule over day and night, times
and seasons: Hence the superstitious ignorance of
those people Deified those lights of Heaven, and
worshipped them as <i>gods</i>. Afterward corruption prevailing,
their <i>Apotheosis</i>, or <i>god-making Ceremonies</i>,
were extended to sublunary creatures, partly as
<i>Symbola</i>, or representative signs of those greater
and more glorious lights; for this reason the <i>Chaldeans</i>
worship <i>fire</i>: ‎‏אור‏‎, and <i>Ur</i>, of the <i>Chaldeans</i>, mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>,
<i>Gen. 11.</i> which signifieth <i>fire</i> or light, is thought
to be the very <i>god</i> of the <i>Chaldeans</i>, though in that
place the name <i>Ur</i> be applyed to some chief City,
from the name of the Idol. Yea, the <i>god of</i> Nahor,
<i>Gen. 31. 53.</i> is thought to be no other; partly, also
the inferiour creatures were canonized for <i>gods</i>, in
way of thankfulness for the benefits received from
them, for which reason the <i>Sea</i>, the <i>Winds</i>, the <i>Air</i>,
the <i>Earth</i>, and <i>fruits</i> of the earth, <i>became deified</i>. At
last, <i>well deserving men</i>; nay, <i>Crocodiles</i>, <i>Serpents</i>, <i>Rats</i>,
<i>Cats</i>, <i>Dogs</i>, <i>Garlick</i>, and <i>Onions</i>, were reputed <i>gods</i>.</p>

<p>Of the <i>Idol Moloch</i> we read in divers places of
Scripture, <i>1 King. 11.</i> <i>2 King. 23. 10.</i> <i>Leviticus
18. 21.</i> He is sometimes called <i>Moloch</i>, sometimes
<i>Molech</i>, sometimes <i>Milcom</i>. He was the <i>reputed god</i>,
not only of the <i>Ammonites</i>, but of the <i>Moabites</i>
also.<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> He had his name from ‎‏מלך‏‎ <i>Melac</i>, signifying
to rule or reign. The Seventy <i>Elders</i> translate him,
ἄρχων, βασιλεὺς, a <i>Prince</i>, or <i>King</i>. Such <i>King-Idols</i>
were <i>Adram-melech</i>, and <i>Anam-melech</i>, the <i>gods</i> of
<i>Shephervaim</i>, unto whom that people burnt their
Children in fire.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_393" id="Footnote_393"></a><a href="#FNanchor_393"><span class="label">[393]</span></a> <i>Lorin. in Act.

</div>

<p>I take <i>Moloch</i> and <i>Baal</i> to be one and the same <i>Idol</i>,
they were both names of supremacy and rule, ‎‏בעל‏‎
<i>Baal</i> signifieth a <i>Lord</i> or <i>Master</i>. And ‎‏מלך‏‎ <i>Moloch</i>, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
<i>King</i> or <i>Prince</i>. They had both the same manner of
sacrifice, they burnt their Sons for burnt-offerings
unto <i>Baal</i> likewise, <i>Jer. 19. 5.</i> yea, they built the high
places of <i>Baal</i>, which are in the Valley of <i>Benhinnom</i>,
to cause their Sons and their Daughters to pass
thorow the fire unto <i>Moloch</i>, <i>Jer. 32. 35.</i> In which
Text the place of sacrifice is noted to be one and the
same, common to both Idols, and <i>Moloch</i> put into the
end of the verse, to explain <i>Baal</i> in the beginning
thereof.</p>

<p>Some think them to be different, because the
<i>Planet Jupiter</i> was worshipped under the name of
<i>Baal</i>;<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> but the <i>Planet Saturn</i> is probably thought to
have been worshipped under the name of <i>Moloch</i>.
If we diligently observe Histories, we shall find such
a <i>confusion of the Planets</i>, that the <i>Sun</i>, as it was sometimes
called <i>Baal</i>, sometimes <i>Moloch</i>: so it was sometimes
called <i>Jupiter</i>,<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> sometimes <i>Saturn</i>;<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> and
concerning <i>Baal</i> this is evident: Hence <i>Jupiter</i> was
called by the <i>Phœnicians</i>, <i>Baal-samen</i>, which name is
derived from the <i>Hebrew</i>, and soundeth as much as
<i>Jupiter Olympicus</i>, <i>the Lord of Heaven</i>. For <i>Baal</i> signifieth
<i>Lord</i>, and <i>Shamaim</i>, <i>Heaven</i>. And what is this
<i>Lord of Heaven</i> in the theology of the <i>Heathens</i>, other
than the <i>Sun</i>? who may as well be stiled the <i>King of
Heaven</i>, as the <i>Moon</i> <i>the Queen</i>. Yea, <i>Sanchoniatho</i>,
as <i>Eusebius</i> in the forequoted place relates him, taketh
all these three for one, namely, the <i>Sun</i>, <i>Jupiter</i>, and
<i>Baal-samen</i>.</p>

<p>Concerning <i>Saturn</i>, it is apparent that the <i>Sun</i>
was worshipped under his name: But I find some Expositers
to interpret <i>Moloch</i> to be <i>Mercury</i>,<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> others
<i>Mars</i>:<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> these are but few, and the grounds weak. It is
therefore more generally and more probably thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
that he was <i>Saturn</i>, because as to <i>Moloch</i>, so to <i>Saturn</i>,
the <i>Heathen</i> people did sacrifice their <i>Sons</i>
and <i>Daughters</i>.<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> Secondly, <i>Saturns</i> Image differed
not much from <i>Moloch</i>’s. Of <i>Saturns</i> thus we read,<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a>
<i>It was made of brass, wonderfull for its greatness,
whose hands reaching towards the earth, were so hollow
(ready to clasp) that the youths which were compelled to
come unto him, did fall as it were into a mighty ditch
full of fire.</i> You shall read in a manner the same description
of <i>Moloch</i>. <i>Jalkut</i> commenting on <i>Jeremy</i>,
writeth thus:<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> <i>Though all other houses of Idolatry
were in Jerusalem, yet <span class="antiqua">Moloch</span> was without Jerusalem,
in a place apart. How was he made? He was an Image
of brass; he had seven Chappels, and he was placed before
them, having the face of a Bullock, and hands spread
abroad, like a man that openeth his hands to receive
somewhat from another: and they set it on fire within,
for it was hollow: and every man severally entred, according
to his offering. After what manner? Whosoever
offered a Fowl went into the first Chappel; he that offered
a Sheep, into the second; a Lamb, into the third; a
Calf, into the fourth; a Bullock, into the fifth; an Ox,
into the sixth; and whosoever offered his Son, into the
seventh.</i> Thus <i>Moloch</i> and <i>Saturn</i> agree: <i>First</i>, in
their sacrifice: <i>Secondly</i>, in the form of their Images.
Now these <i>seven chappels</i> built for <i>Moloch</i>, may well
resemble those <i>seven gates</i><a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> with which the <i>Persians</i>
honored the <i>Sun</i>; and as the <i>seven gates</i> did, so might
the <i>seven chappels</i> mystically express the <i>seven Planets</i>,
whereof the <i>Sun</i> was <i>Moloch</i>, i. <i>the King and Prince</i>.
When they sacrificed their sons unto this <i>Idol</i>, they
did beat upon <i>Tabrets</i> and <i>Drums</i>, that the cry of the
Child might not be heard by the Father. Thereupon
was the place called ‎‏תפת‏‎ <i>Tophet</i>, from ‎‏תף‏‎ signifying
a <i>Drum</i>, as likewise from the cry of the Children,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
it was called <i>Gehenna</i>, ‎‏גיא‏‎ signifying a valley,
and ‎‏נהם‏‎ roaring or crying. Some may make the question,
whether that the phrase, <i>The fire of Gehenna</i>,
<i>Matth. 5. 22.</i> had its original from this fire, wherewith
the children were burnt unto <i>Moloch</i>? I answer,
that in this phrase there was not respect only unto
this fire, though by the bitter cries and ejulations of
poor infants, the restless torments in Hell might be
shadowed, yet the perpetuity and everlastingness of
hellish pains I take to be signified herein by allusion
unto that other fire, kept continually burning
for the consuming of dead carkasses, and the filth
brought out of <i>Jerusalem</i>.<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> For <i>Gehenna</i> was reputed
a contemptible place without the City, in the which
they burnt, by means of a fire continually preserved
there, the carkasses, filth and garbidge of the City.
The <i>Cabalists</i><a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> treating of <i>Gehenna</i>, in this metaphorical
sense, as it is applied to the pains of hell, do
distinguish of it, saying, That there is <i>Gehenna superiour</i>;
and <i>inferiour</i>, by the first they understand <i>bodily
torments inflicted upon the bodies of sinners in this
world</i>: by the second they understand the <i>pains of the
soul in the world to come</i>. They say likewise<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a> that
there are <i>Septem Gehennæ mansiones</i>, <i>Seven degrees or
mansion places in Gehenna</i>. 1. <i>Infernus.</i> 2. <i>Perditio.</i>
3. <i>Profundum.</i> 4. <i>Taciturnitas.</i> 5. <i>Umbra mortis.</i>
6. <i>Terra inferior.</i> 7. <i>Terra sitiens.</i> Of these <i>seven receptacles</i>,
he that will mispend his time may read according
to the quotation.</p>

<p>It is much controversed among Expositors, whether
the children in this sacrifice <i>were burnt in the fire</i>
or only <i>initiated and consecrated to <span class="antiqua">Moloch</span>, passing
in the middest of two fires in sign of their consecration</i>?
It is probable, that both were in use. <i>First</i>, the Scripture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
speaketh of both. <i>Secondly</i>, the <i>Hebrew Doctors</i>
shew the manner of both. That they were <i>burnt</i>,
<i>Jalkut</i> expressly teacheth, and with him others accord,<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a>
saying, <i>That Molech is the name of an Image;
and the wise men of blessed memory interpret Molech to
be an universal name, denoting any whom they made
to rule over them: And it is agreed upon, that this
is the abomination of the Sons of Ammon, and this
phrase, to cause to pass thorow, is as much as, to burn.</i> Others
say,<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> <i>This Idols name was Molech, and this
was his worship: That he (namely, the Father) delivered
his son unto the Priests, and they made two great fires;
and they made his son pass on his feet between both these
fires.</i></p>

<p>Notwithstanding, we must not think that there
were no other oblations unto <i>Molech</i>, besides sacrificing
of children: For what use then served those other
six Chappels? No: I take this oblation of children
not to have been forced on them by any superstitious
law, or tradition, binding them thereunto;
but to have been reputed a work more meritorious,
because it was meerly voluntary. This I note,
because otherwise there were an apparent difference
between <i>Baal</i> and <i>Moloch</i>. For the <i>Baalites</i> offered
unto their fancied Deity a Bullock, in that contention
between them and <i>Eliah</i>, <i>1 Kings 18.</i> Bullocks,
and Calves, and Lambs, were their ordinary sacrifices,
the sacrificing of their children, <i>extraordinary</i>.
Yet their ordinary sacrifices, were not always altogether
void of mans blood, but sometimes the <i>Priests</i>
would lance and cut their own flesh: which custome,
whence it had its original, I find not: only we find
the like to have been practised by the <i>Heathenish
Priests</i> in their sacrifices to <i>Bellona</i>: <i>Tertullian</i><a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a> toucheth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
it, but <i>Lactantius</i><a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> treating of <i>Bellona</i> and her
<i>Priests</i>, speaketh more clearly, saying, <i>They sacrificed
not with any other mans blood, but with their own; their
shoulders being lanced, and with both hands brandishing
naked swords, they run and leaped up and down like mad
men</i>. Who would not take these <i>Bellonites</i> to be the
very <i>Baalites</i>, spoken of, <i>1 Kings 18.</i> <i>They leapt upon
the Altar which was made &mdash;&mdash; and cut themselves as
their manner was, with knives and lances, till the blood
gushed out upon them.</i></p>

<p>That the opinion of pleasing <i>God</i> by sacrificing
their children sprang from <i>Abraham</i>’s offering of <i>Isaac</i>,
seemeth very probable, and is intimated by <i>R.
Solomon</i>, who bringeth in <i>God</i> speaking concerning
<i>Moloch</i> after this manner: <i>I never commanded that they
should offer up their sons for an oblation, and I never
spake it unto any of my Prophets:<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> and when I spake to</i>
Abraham <i>to sacrifice his son, it entred not into my heart
that he should sacrifice him, but to make known his righteousness</i>,
Yea <i>Porphyry</i><a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> treating of <i>Saturn</i>, (who
seemeth to have been this very <i>Moloch</i>) saith, that
the <i>Phœnicians</i> called him <i>Israel</i>, and that he had by
<i>Anobreth</i> one only son called <i>Jeud</i> in the <i>Phœnician</i>
language, (no doubt from the <i>Hebrew</i> <i>Jechid</i>, signifying
an <i>only begotten</i>, and applied to <i>Isaac</i>, <i>Gen. 22. 2.</i>)
which he offered upon an <i>Altar</i> purposely prepared.
Who seeth not the History of <i>Abraham</i> and <i>Sarah</i>
under the names of <i>Israel</i> and <i>Anobreth</i>? and the immolation
of <i>Isaac</i> under the name of <i>Jeud</i>? and the
original of this Son-sacrificing Divinity, to have been
the unwarrantable imitation of <i>Abraham</i>?</p>

<p>But what! Was the <i>Sun</i> worshipped <i>Idolatrously</i>, no
otherwise? Yes, except I am deceived, we find
another manner of worship described by <i>Amos</i>, <i>Chap.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>

a <i>Tabernacle</i>. Secondly, it is rendred the Tabernacle
of <i>Moloch</i>, not <i>Siccuth</i> your King, by the <i>Seventy</i>.
Thirdly, it is so repeated by Saint <i>Stephen</i><a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a>
<i>Act. 7. 43.</i> <i>Ye took up the Tabernacle of Moloch</i>, and

<p>Three things are to be enquired for the understanding
of this parrallel. First, what the <i>bearing or taking
up of this Tabernacle is</i>. Secondly, what Idol was
pointed out by these names of <i>Chiun</i> and <i>Remphan</i>.
Thirdly, what is meant by the <i>star of this God</i>.</p>

<p><i>The taking up of this Tabernacle</i> denoteth their worship
which they exhibited unto their Idol, by carrying
him up and down in <i>Tabernacles</i> and <i>Pageants</i>, after
a solemn manner of procession: By the <i>Romans</i>
this solemnity was termed <i>pompa</i>, and the <i>Tent</i> or <i>Pageant</i>
in which the Idol was carried, <i>Thensa</i>, according
to that, <i>Thensa Deorum vehiculum</i>. This kind of Idolatry
may seem to have had its original among the <i>Heathens</i>
from an unwarrantable imitation of <i>Moses</i>’s <i>Tabernacle</i>,
which was nothing else but a <i>portable Temple</i><a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>
to be carried from place to place, as need required.
For it cannot be denied, but that many superstitions
were derived unto the <i>Heathens</i> from the true worship
of <i>God</i>, which he himself had prescribed unto his
people. Thus, as <i>God</i> had his <i>Tabernacle</i>, <i>Priests</i>, <i>Altars</i>,
and <i>Sacrifices</i>, so the <i>devil</i> had his <i>Tabernacles</i>, <i>Priests</i>,
<i>Altars</i> and <i>Sacrifices</i>. As <i>God</i> had his <i>Fire ever burning
upon the Altar</i>, so had the <i>devil</i> his <i>fire preserved burning
by those Vestal Votaries</i>. As <i>God</i> had his <i>Propitiatory</i> or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Mercy seat:<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> so had the <i>devil</i> his <i>Sacros tripodas</i>, his
<i>Oracles</i>, from which he would speak unto them that
served him. This solemn procession was performed
by the <i>Romans</i> in the honour of the <i>Sun</i>.<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> It was
performed by the <i>Israelites</i> in honour of their <i>Moloch</i>,
who formerly was interpreted, the <i>Sun</i>. To add unto
the pomp and state of this solemnity, both the <i>Romans</i>
and the <i>Israelites</i> caused <i>great Horses</i> and <i>Chariots</i>
to be led up and down. <i>Horses</i> were consecrated
to the <i>Sun</i> by the <i>Romans</i>, and their <i>Cirque place</i>
was sometimes called τὸ ἱππικὸν, and ἱπποδρόμιον, an
<i>Horse-race</i>.<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> And that <i>Chariots</i> was commonly used in
those pompous shewes is evident.<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> Concerning the
people of <i>Judah</i>, doth not the like practice plainly appear?
<i>2 Kings 23.</i> <i>Josiah</i> did put down the <i>Horses</i>
given to the <i>Sun</i>, and the <i>Chariots of the Sun</i>. This
kind of Idolatrous worshipping the <i>Sun</i> seemeth to
have had its beginning from the <i>Persians</i>, who also accounted
<i>Horses</i> holy to the <i>Sun</i>:<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> And the <i>Persian
King</i>, when he would shew himself in great state,
caused an exceeding great <i>Horse</i> to be led up and
down, the which was called <i>Equus solis</i>.</p>

<p>The second inquiry is, What <i>Idol</i> was meant by
<i>Chiun</i> and <i>Remphan</i>, otherwise in ancient Copies
called <i>Repham</i>. Not to trouble the Reader with the
various interpretations of <i>Expositors</i>, much less with
the bold adventures of others in correcting the text:
by <i>Chiun</i> we are to understand <i>Hercules</i>, who in the
<i>Egyptian</i> language was called <i>Chon</i>: by <i>Repham</i> we are
to understand the same <i>Hercules</i>, for ‎‏רפאים‏‎ <i>Rephaim</i>,
in the holy tongue signifieth <i>Gyant</i>: By <i>Hercules</i> we
may understand the Planet of the <i>Sun</i>: There are <i>Etymologists</i>
that derive <i>Hercules</i> his name from the <i>Hebrew</i> ‎‏האיר כל‏‎,
<i>Heircol</i>, <i>illuminavit omnia</i>: the <i>Greek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
Etymology</i>,<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> holds correspondency with the <i>Hebrew</i>
and both signifie that universal light which floweth
from the <i>Sun</i> as water from a fountain. Add hereunto,
that <i>Porphyry</i><a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> interpreteth <i>Hercules his twelve
labours</i>, so often mentioned by the <i>Poets</i>, to be nothing
else but the <i>twelve signs of the Zodiack</i>, thorow
which the <i>Sun</i> passeth yearly. But some may question,
whether the name of <i>Hercules</i> was ever known to
the <i>Jews</i>? It is probable the name was; for <i>Hercules</i>
was the <i>god</i> of the <i>Tyrians</i>, from whom the <i>Jews</i> learned
much <i>Idolatry</i>, as being their near Neighbours:
Yea, it is apparent, that in the time of the <i>Maccabees</i>
the name was commonly known unto them: for <i>Jason</i>
the <i>High-Priest</i> sent three hundred drachmes of silver
to the sacrifice of <i>Hercules</i>, <i>2 Mac. 4. 19.</i></p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, it followeth that we should enquire, what

that it was a certain <i>star painted in the forehead of

<p>The <i>Sun</i> was also worshipped by the house of
<i>Judah</i>, under the name <i>Tamuz</i>; for <i>Tamuz</i>, saith
<i>Hierom</i>,<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> was <i>Adonis</i>, and <i>Adonis</i> generally interpreted
the <i>Sun</i>,<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> from the <i>Hebrew</i> <i>Adon</i>, signifying
<i>Dominus</i>, the same as <i>Baal</i>, or <i>Moloch</i> formerly did,
namely, the <i>Lord</i> or <i>Prince</i> of the <i>Planets</i>. The month
which we call <i>June</i>, was by the <i>Hebrews</i> called <i>Tamuz</i>;
and the entrance of the <i>Sun</i> into the sign
<i>Cancer</i> was, in the <i>Jews Astronomy</i>, termed <i>Tekuphu
Tamuz</i>, the <i>revolution</i> of <i>Tamuz</i>. Concerning <i>Adonis</i>
whom sometime ancient Authors called <i>Osiris</i>; there
are two things remarkable, ἀφανισμὸς, the <i>death or loss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
of Adonis</i> and εὕρησις, the <i>finding of him again</i>. As there
was great lamentation<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> at his loss, especially amongst
the Women;<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> so was there great joy at
his <i>finding</i>. By the death or <i>loss of Adonis</i>, we are
to understand the departure of the <i>Sun</i>; by his <i>finding
again</i>, we are to understand his return. Now he
seemeth to depart twice in the year: First, when he
is in the <i>Tropick of Cancer</i>, in the farthest degree
Northward. Secondly, when he is in the <i>Tropick of
Capricorn</i>, in the farthest degree Southward: answerable
unto these two departures, which may be termed
ἀφανισμοὶ, <i>disparitions</i>, or <i>losses of the Sun</i>, there are
two returns immediately succeeding, which may be
termed likewise εὑρήσεις, the <i>findings</i> or new appearings
of the <i>Sun</i>. Hence we may note, that though
the <i>Egyptians</i> celebrated their <i>Adonia</i> in the moneth
of <i>November</i>, when the <i>Sun</i> began to be farthest
<i>Southward</i>; and the house of <i>Judah</i> theirs, in the month
of <i>June</i>, when the <i>Sun</i> was farthest <i>Northward</i>, yet
both were for the same reasons, and in substance they
agreed. And of this the Prophet <i>Ezekiel</i> is thought
to have spoken, <i>Ezek. 8. 14.</i> <i>There sate women weeping

<p>These solemnities were chiefly observed, between

thus:<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> When the <i>Byblienses</i> solemnized the death or
loss of <i>Adonis</i>, at that time the <i>Alexandrini</i> wrote a
letter, this letter was inclosed in an <i>Ark of Bulrushes</i>,
therein they signified, that <i>Adonis</i>, whom they lamented,
was found again, this Ark, being after
the performance of certain rites and ceremonies,
committed to the Sea, forthwith it was carried
by the stream to <i>Biblus</i>; upon the receit whereof,
the lamentation of the Women was turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
into joy. Others say,<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> that this lamentation was
performed over an Image in the night season, and
when they had sufficiently lamented, a Candle was
brought into the room (which Ceremony might
mystically signifie the return of the Sun) then the
Priest with a soft voice muttered this form of
words<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> <i>Trust ye in God, for out of pains salvation is

<p>Whom the <i>Hebrews</i> called <i>Baal</i>, the <i>Babylonians</i>
called <i>Bell</i>; and although the <i>Planet
of the Sun</i> only at first might be worshipped under
that name, yet at last it became a common name
to many other Idols, according to that, <i>There
are many Gods, many Baalims or Lords</i>, <i>1 Cor. 8. 5.</i> As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the same Idol <i>Jupiter</i> had different names, and different
Rites of worship, occasioned sometimes from
the different places, as <i>Jupiter Olympius</i>, from the Hill
<i>Olympus</i>; <i>Jupiter Capitolinus</i>, from the <i>Capitol hill</i>; <i>Jupiter
Latialis</i>, from that part of <i>Italy</i> which is called
<i>Latium</i>. Sometimes from the different benefits which
he was supposed to bestow on men, as <i>Jupiter Pluvius</i>
because he gave <i>Rain</i>; <i>Jupiter Lucetius</i>, because he
gave <i>Light</i>; <i>Jupiter Altitonans</i>, from <i>thundring</i>; So
<i>Baal</i> had his distinctive Titles, and different Rites
of worship, sometimes occasioned by the place, as
<i>Baal-Peor</i>, <i>Numb. 25. 3.</i> sometimes from the benefit obtained,
as <i>Baal-Tsephon</i>, <i>Exod. 14. 1.</i> and <i>Baal-Zebub</i>,
<i>2 King. 1. 2.</i> sometimes for some other reason, as <i>Baal-Berith</i>,
<i>Judg. 8. 33.</i></p>

<p><i>Baal-Peor</i> is thought<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> to be that <i>Priapus</i>, that
obscene <i>Idol</i>, so famous in prophane Authors. He
was called <i>Peor</i>, from the Hill <i>Peor</i>, mentioned,
<i>Numb. 23. 28.</i> as likewise his Temple wherein he
was worshipped, standing upon the same Hill, was
called <i>Beth-Peor</i>, <i>Deut. 3. 29.</i> He was worshipped
by the <i>Moabites</i> and <i>Midianites</i>: the <i>Idol Chemish</i>,
<i>Jer. 48. 7.</i> is thought to be the same,<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> and I take it
to be applied to <i>Baal Peor</i>, by way of contempt, as if
one should say, their <i>blind god</i>, according to that in
the Psalm, <i>They have eyes and see not</i>. For the first

<p><i>Baal-Tsephon</i> is thought by the <i>Hebrews</i>,<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> to have

over the rest, in which respect the <i>Prince of

the <i>Cyrenians</i>,<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> but principally by the <i>Ekronites</i>, because
whensoever they sacrificed unto him, the
swarms of <i>flies</i> which at that time molested the Country,
died. But it is certain, that this was not the alone
reason, for they were wont to repair to him, as to
an Oracle, <i>2 King. 1. 2.</i> We may call him <i>Jupiter muscarius</i>,
or <i>Hercules muscarius</i>:<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> for the Inhabitants
of the City <i>Elis</i> sacrificed to <i>Jupiter</i> under the name
ἀπομύιος, (<i>i.</i>) <i>A driver away of flies</i>: and the <i>Romans</i> to
<i>Hercules</i>, under the same name. Some <i>Greek Copies</i> in
the <i>Gospel</i> read Βεελζεβοὺλ, <i>Beelzebul</i>: which change is
interpreted to be, for to shew the greater contempt
of the <i>Idol</i>, as if they should say <i>Jupiter stercoreus</i>, ‎‏זבל‏‎
<i>Zebel</i> signifieth <i>stercus</i>, and <i>Beel</i>, or <i>Baal</i>, signifieth

<span class="smaller"><i>Of Dagon.</i></span></h3>

<p>The <i>Hebrew Doctors</i> say<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> this Idol <i>Dagon
was made from the Navel downward in form of a
Fish, but from the Navel upward in form of a Man</i>.
This they collect from <i>1 Sam. 5. 4.</i> The <i>two palms of
his hands were cut off upon the threshold</i>. And furthermore
they say, The Idol <i>Dagon</i> had his name from
the <i>Hebrew</i> ‎‏דג‏‎ <i>Dag</i>, signifying in the Holy Language,
a <i>fish</i>, according to which description we may English
him, the <i>Philistians Neptune</i>, or <i>Triton</i>.<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> Others derive
the name from ‎‏דגן‏‎ <i>Dagon</i>, signifying <i>Corn</i>: and
they say,<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> that he first invented the use of the
<i>Plow</i>, and <i>Corn</i>; whence they translate him <i>Jupiter
aratrius</i>. In this respect we call him the <i>Philistians
Saturn</i>, because Antiquity<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> makes <i>Saturn</i> the <i>first
Inventer of Husbandry</i>, and therefore paints him with
an <i>Hook</i> or <i>Sithe</i> in his hand, as being the fittest <i>Hieroglyphick</i>
for <i>Husbandry</i>. Both opinions have their
Authors, and no sufficient proof hath been produced
to overthrow either. Yea, they are not wanting
among the <i>Jews</i> themselves, that say,<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> this Image of
<i>Dagon was made in the form of a man</i>. Notwithstanding
<i>Scaliger</i> his conjecture is not improbable, that
those who interpret <i>Dagon</i>, <i>Jupiter aratrius</i>, or
Ἀγροτὴς, might mistake and read ‎‏שדי‏‎ <i>Shadai</i>, signifying
<i>Ager</i>, <i>A field</i>, for ‎‏שדי‏‎ <i>Shaddai</i> being the very
Name of God, signifying <i>Omnipotens</i>, <i>Almighty</i>.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of the molten Calf.</i></span></h3>

<p>The History of the <i>Molten Calf</i> is at large set
down, <i>Exod. 32.</i>, where we read, that by reason
of <i>Moses</i> his long absence, the people desired
of <i>Aaron</i>, <i>gods</i> to be made; whereupon <i>Aaron</i> made
for them the <i>molten Calf</i>. The reason why they
worshipped <i>God</i> rather in the similitude of a <i>Calf</i>,
than of any other Creature, is generally by <i>Expositors</i>
conceived to be from the corruptions learned
among the <i>Egyptians</i>, who worshipped their
Idol <i>Apis</i>,<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> otherwise called <i>Serapis</i>,<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> in a living
<i>Oxe</i>, and otherwise in an Image made in the form and
similitude of an <i>Oxe</i>, with a bushel on his head. This
<i>Oxe</i> was remarkable for certain notes and marks,
whereby it was differenced from all others. It was
<i>black bodied</i>, it had a <i>white fore-head</i>, and <i>white spot
behind</i>, and a <i>knot</i> under his tongue: for the more curious
fashioning and pollishing of these marks in the
<i>molten Calf</i>, <i>Aaron</i> may seem to have made use of
his <i>graving tool</i>.<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> The <i>Egyptians</i> repaired unto
this <i>Oxe</i> for the resolution of matters doubtful, as
to an <i>Oracle</i>,<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> and the manner of consulting with
him, was thus. The party that repaired unto him,
tendred a bottle of Hay, or Grass; which if he received,
then it betokened a good and happy event; if
otherwise he refused it, then it did portend some
evil to come. <i>Thus they turned their glory into an Oxe
that eateth grass</i>, <i>Psalm 106. 20.</i> The <i>Hebrew</i> word in
the <i>Psalm</i>, translated an <i>Oxe</i>, is, <i>Shar</i>;<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> which I
note, because in my opinion, it giveth light to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
of the names by which this <i>Idol</i> was denoted. Sometimes
it was called <i>Apis</i>, from the <i>Hebrew</i> word
<i>Ap</i>,<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> signifying a <i>face</i>: sometimes <i>Serapis quasi Shor-apis</i>,
which is nothing else but <i>Bovis caput</i>, an <i>Ox-head</i>;
the very name used by the <i>Fathers</i><a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> to express this
<i>Idolatry</i>. It is commonly known that this <i>Idolatry</i> was
derived to <i>Israel</i> from the <i>Egyptians</i>; but whence
the <i>Egyptians</i> first learned it few have taught. They
do not conjecture amiss, who interpret the first Institution
hereof to have been in the memory of <i>Joseph</i>,
who by his providence relieved both <i>Egypt</i>,
and other Neighbour Countries, in the seven years of
famine. Besides the testimony of no slight Authors,<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a>
there are strong inducements to perswade it.
<i>First</i>, both the years of plenty and famine were foresignified
by the apparition of <i>Oxen</i>. <i>Secondly</i>, what
fitter Emblem, (if it had not afterward proved an
<i>Idol</i>) to continue the remembrance of a <i>Joseph</i>, (by
whose alone care and industry, corn and victual was
provided in an extream famine) than an <i>Ox</i>, the
true and lively Hieroglyphick of an industrious
Husbandman? <i>Thirdly</i>, in this <i>Suidas</i> agreeth with
others, that <i>this Ox was pourtrayed with a bushel on his
head</i>, though others do more clearly express the
reason of this portraiture, namely, because of the
great quantity of Corn measured out by <i>Joseph</i> in
that extream dearth. Concerning the sin of the <i>Israelites</i>
in making this <i>Calf</i> or <i>Ox</i>, the modern <i>Jews</i> do
transfer the fault upon certain <i>Prosylite Egyptians</i>
who came forth with them: and they say, that
when <i>Aaron</i> cast their Jewels into the fire, these
<i>Egyptians</i>, contrary to his expectation, by their Art
<i>Magick</i> produceth a Calf, to which purpose they urge
<i>Aarons</i> own words, <i>Exod. 32. 34.</i> I did cast the Gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
into the fire, and <i>thereof came this Calf</i>, as if his
art or will went not with the making thereof, but
<i>of it self it made it self</i>. But this answer of his sheweth
rather, how vain the wit of man is in the excuse of
sin; and as his ingraving instrument writes down
<i>Aaron</i>’s sins; so the confession of others, more ingenuous
<i>Jews</i> proclaims the <i>Israelites</i>, saying,<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> that
<i>No punishment befalleth thee <span class="antiqua">Israel</span>, in which there is
not an ounce of this Calf</i>. I conclude this with the analogy
between the <i>Egyptian Apis</i>, and the <i>molten Calf</i>:
and this consisteth in three things. <i>First</i>, As there
were some <i>special marks in the Egyptians Ox</i>; so is it
probable that <i>Aaron</i> with his ingraving Tool made
the like. <i>Secondly</i>, As the <i>Egyptians</i> in honor of their
<i>Ox</i> celebrated a <i>solemn Feast</i>, with much singing
and mirth.<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> So the <i>Israelites</i> proclaimed a feast in honor
of their <i>Calf</i>: <i>The people sate down to eat and drink,
and rose up to play</i>. <i>Thirdly</i>, As the <i>Egyptians Ox</i> was
at last drowned in the River, so <i>Moses</i> burnt the
<i>molten Calf</i>, and beat it to powder, and cast it upon
the face of the water, <i>Exod. 32. 10.</i> <i>Deut. 9. 21.</i> <i>Jeroboam</i>
afterward, though upon other inducements, committed
the same sin; he thought in his heart, that if
the people go up to <i>Jerusalem</i>, and do sacrifice in the
<i>house of the Lord</i>, they would revolt from him, and return

<span class="smaller"><i>Of <span class="antiqua">Astaroth</span>, <span class="antiqua">Ammonia</span>, <span class="antiqua">Juno</span>, the Queen of Heaven,

<p>As the <i>Sun</i> was worshipped under many names,
so likewise the <i>Moon</i>. <i>Astaroth</i> was the <i>Idol</i>
chiefly of the <i>Zidonians</i>, <i>1 King. 11. 5.</i> <i>2 King. 23. 13.</i>
she had her <i>Temple</i>, called the house of <i>Astaroth</i>, in
which the <i>Philistims</i> hanged up <i>Saul</i>’s Armor<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a>
after his death, <i>1 Sam. 31. 10.</i> That the <i>Moon</i> was
worshipped under these names needs not proof;<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>
only some say,<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> that <i>Astarte</i> was <i>Juno</i>: and why
may we not say, that <i>Juno</i> was often used to express
the <i>Moon</i>? Both the <i>Moon</i> and <i>Juno</i> are often
called by the name of <i>Urania</i>.<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> And as the <i>Moon</i> in
respect of her light is called <i>Urania</i>; so in regard of
the lesser lights in the heaven, she is called <i>Astroarche</i>
that is, the <i>Queen of the Planets</i>;<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> or as <i>Horace</i>
speaketh of the <i>Moon</i>, <i>Siderum Regina</i>, the <i>Queen of
the Stars</i>: Or lastly, as <i>Virgil</i> speaketh of <i>Juno</i>; <i>Divum
incedo regina</i>, the <i>Queen of the Gods</i>. It seemeth
very probable, that this is that <i>Queen of Heaven</i>, of
which the <i>Prophet</i> speaketh, <i>Jer. 7. 18.</i> <i>Jer. 44. 17.</i>
Again, unto whom may we imagine those ancient
Heathens to have performed that solemn worship,
which they did on the <i>Calends</i>, or first day of every
month (was it not to the <i>Moon</i>?) And yet notwithstanding
it is ascribed to <i>Juno</i> whence she is called
<i>Juno Calendaris</i>.<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> Lastly, As <i>Jupiter Ammon</i> was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
other than the <i>Sun</i>,<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> and worshipped him in form of a
<i>Ram</i>; so for ought I see, the <i>Moon</i> might be called <i>Juno
Ammonia</i>, and worshipped in the form of a <i>sheep</i>.<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a>
Sure I am, that the <i>Hebrew Doctors</i><a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> describe the Images
of <i>Astaroth</i>, to have been made in the form of
<i>sheep</i>; and the word <i>Astaroth</i>, in the Original, signifieth
a <i>flock of sheep</i>, and the <i>Moon</i> might as well be called
<i>Ammonia</i>, as the <i>Sun</i> <i>Ammon</i>, both being so called
from their <i>heat</i>, which in the Holy Tongue is called
<i>Hammah</i>,<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> and from thence likewise those Images
(of which we read, <i>Levit. 26. 30.</i> <i>Isa. 17. 8.</i> <i>Isa. 27. 9.</i>)
are called <i>Hammianim</i>,<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> because they were certain
Idols placed upon the house top, and so alwayes
exposed to the <i>Sun</i>. Furthermore, as <i>Jupiter Ammon</i>
was painted with <i>horns</i>,<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> so likewise was the
<i>Moon</i>:<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> why they should be thus painted, many reasons
might be produced, but chiefly three; the <i>first</i>
peculiar to the <i>Sun</i>, the other common both to <i>Sun</i>
and <i>Moon</i>. First, the <i>Sun</i> was painted with <i>Rams horns</i>,
because with the Astronomers the sign <i>Aries</i> in the
<i>Zodiack</i> is the beginning of the year.<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> Secondly,
because as the strength of <i>horned beasts</i> consists in
their <i>horns</i>, so the virtue and influence of the <i>Sun</i>
and <i>Moon</i> is derived into sublunary creatures by
their beams. Thirdly, because the light of the <i>Sun</i>
and <i>Moon</i> makes the reflection <i>cornute</i>, or <i>horn-like</i>.
When <i>Moses</i> came down from God, <i>Aaron</i> and the
people saw that his face shined, <i>Exod. 34.</i> the <i>Latine</i>
reads it, <i>Facies ejus erat cornuta</i>: and hence it is, that
<i>Moses</i> is painted with <i>horns</i>, which some of the
<i>Rabbines</i> have interpreted<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> <i>horns of magnificence</i>.
The errour grew from the doubtful signification of
the <i>Hebrew</i> word signifying <i>splendor</i> or <i>brightness</i> and
also <i>horns</i>.</p>

among the <i>Ephesians</i>, whence arose that cry, <i>Great is
Diana of the Ephesians</i>, <i>Act. 19. 28.</i> Her greatness among
the <i>Ephesians</i> appeareth partly by her <i>Temple</i>;
which in one place <i>Pliny</i> saith<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> was two hundred
and twenty years abuilding, but elsewhere<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a> he
saith 400 years: partly from the great gain procured
unto the Silver-smiths in making and selling <i>silver
Temples of Diana</i>. <i>Act. 19. 24.</i> It is much disputed
what those <i>silver Temples</i> were; some think them to
be <i>little houses</i>, or <i>shrines</i> (such as were for their
smallness portable) in form representing the <i>Temple
of Diana</i>, and within having the Image of <i>Diana</i> inclosed,
and in this sense ναίδια is sometimes used, to
signifie <i>closets</i> or <i>shrines wherein Images were kept</i>: Others
think, certain coyns or pieces of money to be
called by the name of <i>Diana</i>’s <i>Temple</i>, from the similitude
of <i>Diana</i>’s <i>Temple</i> engraven or stamped upon
those coyns: as in <i>England</i> we call some pieces of
gold the <i>George</i>, others the <i>Angel</i>, others the <i>Thistle</i>,
from the impression which they bear. The like custom
of naming coyns from their Sculpture or impression
was not unusual among the Ancients;<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> neither
were such coyns unusual on which the <i>Temple of
Diana</i> was engraven, and these capital letters added,

of these himself.</p>

that God had respect unto this kind of <i>Idolatry</i>, <i>Deut.

<span class="smaller"><i>Of other Gods mentioned in Scripture.</i></span></h3>

<p>The <i>Sun</i> and <i>Moon</i>, which are the greater lights
in the Heaven, I take to have been the chiefest
Idols worshipped by the <i>Heathen</i> people. Notwithstanding,
their blind devotion deified also the other
<i>Planets</i>, and that numberless number of lesser lights,
called in Scripture, <i>Militia Cœli</i>, The Host of Heaven,
whose several natures, properties and influences,
are not distinctly known. In like manner there is an
<i>Host of Idols</i> mentioned in Holy Writ, of whom little
or nothing is spoken to the purpose by Authors,
more than their very names. Of this nature are those
<i>Chambers of Imagery</i>, wherein all forms of creeping
things were pourtrayed on the walls, <i>Ezek. 8.</i> It may
be termed their <i>Pantheon</i>.</p>

<p>In those Colonies which the <i>King</i> of <i>Ashur</i> transplanted
into <i>Samaria</i>, every one worshipped the <i>god</i>
of his own Nation. The men of <i>Babel</i> made <i>Succoth
Benoth</i>, the men of <i>Cuth</i> made <i>Nergal</i>, the men of <i>Hamath</i>
made <i>Ashima</i>, the <i>Avims</i> made <i>Nibhaz</i> and <i>Tartak</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the <i>Sepharvaims</i> burnt their Children in the fire
to <i>Adram-melech</i>, and <i>Anammelch</i> the <i>gods of Sepharvaim</i>,
<i>2 King. 17. 30, 31.</i> The <i>Hebrew Doctors</i> say,<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>
that <i>Succoth Benoth</i> was the picture of an <i>Hen with her
Chicken</i>: <i>Nergal</i> they interpret <i>Gallum Sylvestrem</i>, <i>Asima</i>
a Goat, <i>Nibhaz</i> a Dog, <i>Tartak</i> an Ass, <i>Adrammelech</i>
a Mule, <i>Anammelech</i> an Horse: that such brute
beasts should be worshipped as <i>gods</i>, may seem ridiculous;
but the like to have been practised among the
<i>Heathens</i>, profane Authors abundantly testifie. The
<i>Cock</i> was worshipped as a <i>god</i> among the <i>Syrians</i>,<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a>
A <i>Goat</i> by the <i>Mendesii</i>;<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> A <i>Dog</i> by others:<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> Yea,

<i>Oxen, Lyons, Eagles, Wolves, Crocodiles, Cats, Rats</i>,<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a>
Nay, they have digged their <i>gods</i> out of their gardens,
<i>Garlick, Leeks, Onions, &amp;c.</i><a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> To these may be added
<i>Nisroch</i>, which was the <i>god</i> of the <i>Assyrians</i>, and, as
it seemeth, had his <i>Temple</i> at <i>Nineve</i>, <i>2 King. 19. ult.</i>
and <i>Esay. 37. ult.</i> Secondly, ‎‏רמון‏‎ <i>Rimmon</i>, the word
signifieth a <i>Pomegranate</i>. Concerning this Idol it is
much controverted, whether <i>Naaman</i> sinned not in
saying, <i>The Lord be merciful unto thy servant, that when
my Master goeth into the house of Rimmon</i>, &amp;c. <i>2 King. 5.
18.</i> Read the words in the <i>Præter tense</i> (when my <i>Master</i>
went into the house of <i>Rimmon</i>) the sense appears
to be a pardon craved for sins past, not afterward to
be committed. The same word ‎‏בבוא‏‎ <i>Bebbo</i>, <i>in going</i>, is
put to express the time past, in the titles of the <i>Psalms
52.</i> and <i>Psalm 54.</i> Thirdly, <i>Nebo</i> otherwise called
<i>Nabo</i>, an Idol of the <i>Assyrians</i>, <i>Jer. 48. 1.</i> He had his
name from <i>Prophecy</i>, ‎‏נביא‏‎ <i>Nahbi</i>, signifying a <i>Prophet</i>,
he seemeth not much to differ from Ζεὺς βουλαῖος,

<span class="smaller"><i>The several manners of Divine Revelation.</i></span></h3>

<p>As <i>Idolatry</i> originally sprang from mistaking of
Scripture; so Witch-craft and Sorcery, (which
holdeth near affinity with <i>Idolatry</i>) seemeth to have
had its first beginning from an imitation of <i>Gods Oracles</i>.
<i>God spake in divers manners</i>, <i>Heb. 1. 1.</i> <i>By dreams,
by Urim, by Prophets</i>, <i>1 Sam. 28. 6, 7.</i> when the Lord
would by none of these answer King <i>Saul</i>, then he
sought to a Witch. To these might be added <i>Gods</i>
speaking from between the <i>Cherubims</i>, his answering
by <i>Visions</i>, <i>Angels</i>, and <i>Voices</i>: but the chief manners
of revealing himself, observed by the <i>Hebrew</i> Writers,
are four, which they term<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> <i>four degrees
of Prophecy</i>, or <i>Divine Revelation</i>: somewhat therefore
being spoken of these, I purpose to explain the
several sorts of unlawful divinations mentioned in
Scripture.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_486" id="Footnote_486"></a><a href="#FNanchor_486"><span class="label">[486]</span></a> <i>P. Fagius in
Exod. 28.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The first <i>degree</i> was ‎‏נבואה‏‎ <i>Nebuah</i>, <i>Prophecy</i>. This
was when <i>God</i> by certain visions and apparitions revealed
his Will.</p>

<p>The second was ‎‏רוח הקדש‏‎ <i>Ruach Hacodesch</i>, <i>The inspiration
of the Holy Ghost</i>, whereby the party was inabled
without Visions or Apparitions, to prophesie:
some shewing the difference between those two
add,<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> that the gift of Prophecy did cast a man into
a trance or extasie, all his senses being taken from him;
but the inspiration of the Holy Ghost was without
any such extasie, or abolition of the senses, as appeareth
in <i>Job, David, Daniel</i>. Both these degrees, as likewise
<i>Urim</i> and <i>Thummim</i> ceased in the second Temple,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
whence their ancient <i>Doctors</i> say, <a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> that after the
<i>latter Prophets Haggai</i>, <i>Zachary</i>, and <i>Malachy</i> were
dead, the <i>Holy Ghost went up or departed from</i> Israel.
Howbeit, they had the use of a <i>voice</i> or <i>eccho</i> from
<i>Heaven</i>. In which speech we are not to understand that
the <i>Holy Ghost</i> wrought not at all upon the creatures,
or that it wrought not then in the sanctification of
men, as in former times, but that this <i>extraordinary
enabling men to prophesie by the inspiration of the Holy
Ghost</i>, then ceased; and in this sense the <i>Holy Ghost was
said to have departed from <span class="antiqua">Israel</span>.</i> Unto this common
received opinion, that passage might have reference,
<i>Acts 19.</i> <i>We have not so much as heard whether there
hath been an Holy Ghost or no.</i> That they did not doubt
the distinction of persons, appeareth clear, if that be
true which some have noted,<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> that the ancient <i>Jews</i>
before <i>Christ</i> were so catechised in that point, that
they observed the <i>Mystery of the Trinity</i> in the name
‎‏יהוה‏‎ <i>Jehovah</i>, for though the name consisted of four
letters in number, whence it was called τετραγράμματον
<i>Quadriliterum</i>, yet there were but <i>three sorts of Letters
in the name</i>: ‎‏י‏‎ <i>Jod</i> signified the <i>Father</i>, who was the
beginning of all things: ‎‏ו‏‎ <i>Vau</i> is a conjunction copulative,
and denoted the <i>third person in Trinity</i>, which
proceedeth from the <i>Father</i> and the <i>Son</i>, ‎‏ה‏‎ <i>He</i> signifieth
the <i>Son of God</i>. The <i>Rabbines</i> have a saying, that
God made all things, <i>in litera ‎‏ה‏‎ He</i>. They may allude
to this, that he made all things by his Word: he
said, Let there be thus and thus, and it was so: but
they may also allude to the <i>second person in Trinity</i>.
And furthermore, they note that ‎‏ה‏‎ <i>He</i>, is doubled in
this name, to demonstrate both Natures of our blessed
Saviour.</p>

<p>The <i>third degree</i>, was <i>Urim</i> and <i>Thummim</i>. <i>Urim</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
signifieth light, and <i>Thummim</i> perfection. That they
were two ornaments in the <i>High-priests brest-plate</i>, is
generally agreed upon: but what manner of ornaments,
or how they gave answer, is hard to resolve.
Some<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> think them to be the four rows of stones in
the brest-plate, the <i>splendour and brightness</i> of which
foreshewed victory; and by the rule of contraries, we
may gather, that the <i>darkness of the stones</i> not shining
presaged evil. Others<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> say it was the name <i>Jehovah</i>
put in the doubling of the brest-plate, for that was
double <i>Exod. 28. 16.</i> Others<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> declare the manner
of consulting with <i>Urim</i> and <i>Thummim</i> thus: First,
they say<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> that only the <i>King</i>, or else the <i>Father of
the Consistory</i> had power to consult, or to propose the
matter unto the <i>Priest</i>, and the <i>Priest</i> only had power
to resolve. <i>Secondly</i>, that the matter proposed must
not be trivial, but of moment and great difficulty.
<i>Thirdly</i>, that this holy writing, termed <i>Urim</i> and
<i>Thummim</i>, consisted of all the <i>Tribes names</i>, and likewise
of the <i>Patriarchs</i>, <i>Abraham</i>, <i>Isaac</i> and <i>Jacob</i>; so
that no letter of the <i>Alphabet</i> was wanting. The question
being proposed, some say that the letters which
gave the answer were ‎‏כולמות‏‎ (<i>i.</i>) <i>they did arise</i> and
<i>eminently appear above the others</i>. An example they
take from <i>2 Sam. 2. 1.</i> When <i>David</i> asked the
Lord, Shall I go up into any of the Cities of <i>Judah</i>?
the Lord answered, ‎‏עלה‏‎ <i>Gnaleh</i>, <i>go up</i>. Here, say they, ‎‏ע‏‎
appeared out of the name of ‎‏שמעין‏‎ <i>Schimeon</i>, ‎‏ל‏‎
out of the name of ‎‏לוי‏‎ <i>Levi</i>, ‎‏ה‏‎ out of the name of ‎‏יהודה‏‎
<i>Jehudah</i>. Others say, that the letters which
represented the Oracle were ‎‏מצטדפות‏‎ (<i>i.</i>) that they
did after a strange manner <i>joyn themselves into perfect
syllables</i> and entire words, and made the answer compleat.
Many other opinions might be reckoned up,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
but he spoke best, who ingenuously confessed that
he knew not what <i>Urim</i> and <i>Thummim</i> was.<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

<p>The fourth degree was ‎‏בת קול‏‎ <i>Bath Kol</i>, <i>filia vocis</i>,
<i>the Daughter of a Voice</i>, or an <i>Eccho</i>; by it is meant a
<i>voice from heaven declaring the will of God</i>; it took
place in the <i>second Temple</i>, when the three former
degrees of Prophecy ceased: it gave testimony of
our Saviour; Lo, a <i>voice from heaven</i>, saying, <i>This is
my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased</i> <i>Mat. 3. 17.</i> It
was in truth the <i>Prologue</i>, <i>Preface</i>, or <i>type of that true
voice of the Father</i>, that <i>eternal word which revealed
his Fathers will unto mankind</i>.</p>

<p>These were the extraordinary means by which
<i>God</i> revealed himself to his people of old: ordinarily,
he revealed himself by his written word. Notwithstanding
the <i>Hebrews</i> say, that the Law, even
from the first time of its delivery unto <i>Moses</i>, was
twofold: the one committed to writing, which they
call ‎‏תורה שבכתב‏‎ <i>Thora Schebictab</i>, the written Law:
the other delivered by tradition, ‎‏תורה בעל פה‏‎ <i>Thora
begnal pe</i>, it was also termed their <i>Kabbala</i>, from ‎‏קבל‏‎
<i>Kibbel</i>, signifying <i>Accipere</i>, to receive or learn. They
say both were delivered by <i>God</i> unto <i>Moses</i> in Mount
<i>Sinai</i>, but this latter was delivered from <i>Moses to <span class="antiqua">Joshua</span>,
from <span class="antiqua">Joshua</span> to the Elders, from the Elders to the
Prophets, from the Prophets to those of the great Synagogue,
and so successively to after-ages, till at last it was
digested into one Book, containing principally precepts
and directions for those Israelites which inhabited the
holy Land. It is called <span class="antiqua">Talmud Hierosolymitanum</span>. It
was composed in the year of our Lord 230.</i> This because
it containeth but a few constitutions, is but of little
use. About 500 <i>years after Christ</i>, then was there a
more full and exact collection of their constitutions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
for direction of those <i>Jews</i> which dwelt in <i>Babylon</i>,
and other forreign places; this is termed <i>Talmud Babylonicum</i>,
and is of greatest use among Authors; it
containeth the body of <i>their Civil and Canon Law</i>.
This traditional law they hold to be as authentick
as their written word, and that <i>Moses</i> received it
from God, when he received the Law; for, say they,
were it not for this exposition, the <i>Decalogue</i> it self
might have been delivered <i>In hora veloci</i>, <i>in less
than an hour</i>.<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<p>Here we must note that the word <i>Kabbala</i>, when
it is applied to the <i>Kabbalists</i>, to difference them
from the <i>Talmudists</i>, is taken in a stricter sense, and
signifieth those subtleties or mysteries which are observed
from the different writing of some letters in
the Scripture, from the <i>transposing of them</i>, from a
<i>mystical kind of Arithmetick</i>, &amp;c. This was never
wholly committed to writing, of some instances we
have, <i>Gen. 23. 2.</i> <i>Abraham came</i> ‎‏לבכתה‏‎ <i>to weep for Sara</i>.
Here because the letter <i>Caph</i> is less than the rest,
they note<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> that <i>Abraham wept but little for Sara</i>, because
she was old. Again, the letter <i>Aleph</i> is found
six times in the first verse of <i>Genesis</i>: Hence R. <i>Elias</i>
collected that the world should endure but <i>six thousand
years</i>: because <i>Aleph</i> in the <i>Hebrews computation</i>
standeth for a thousand. From the transposition <i>of
letters</i> they conclude after this manner; ‎‏חרם‏‎ <i>Cherem</i>
signifieth <i>Anathema</i> or <i>Excommunication</i>, by a
<i>Metathesis</i> or <i>transposition of letters</i>, it is made ‎‏רחם‏‎
<i>Rachem</i> signifying <i>mercy</i>; by another <i>transposition</i> it
is made ‎‏רמח‏‎ <i>Ramach</i>, which letters in the <i>Jews computation</i>
make 248, which in their Anatomy, they
find to be the just number of members in a mans
body: their conclusion hence is, that if <i>an excommunicated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
person do truly repent then his <span class="antiqua">Cherem</span> is turned
into <span class="antiqua">Rachem</span>, his curse turned into a blessing: if he
do not repent, then his <span class="antiqua">Cherem</span> entreth into <span class="antiqua">Ramach</span>,
the curse entreth into all his members</i>, to the utter destroying
of the whole man. Again, ‎‏איש‏‎ <i>Isch</i>, signifieth
<i>a man</i>. ‎‏אשה‏‎ <i>Escha</i>, <i>a woman</i>. Hence they note,
that in the <i>name of the man</i> here is ‎‏י‏‎ <i>Jod</i> which is
not in the <i>name of the woman</i>; in the <i>name of the woman</i>
there is ‎‏ה‏‎ <i>He</i>, which is not in the <i>name of the
man</i>: both these make ‎‏יה‏‎ <i>Jah</i>, one of the names of
God: these being taken away, in both names there
remains ‎‏אש‏‎ <i>Esch</i> signifying <i>fire</i>, to shew, that as long
as man and wife agree, <i>God is with them</i>: but when
they disagree, <i>fire is between them</i>: Thus we see
what vain mysteries their <i>Kabbalists</i> observe.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Their Teraphim.</i></span></h3>

<p>Concerning the <i>Teraphim</i>, two things are especially
to be enquired. <i>First</i>, what they were?
<i>Secondly</i>, for what use? the word ‎‏תרף‏‎ <i>Taraph</i>,
signifieth in general the <i>compleat Image of a man</i>. <i>Michal</i>
took an <i>image</i>, (<i>a Teraphim</i>) and laid it in the
bed, <i>1 Sam. 19. 13.</i> More particularly it signifieth an
<i>Idol</i> or <i>image made for mens private use in their own
houses</i>, so that these images seem to have been their
<i>Penates</i> or <i>Lares</i>, their houshould <i>gods</i>; wherefore
hast thou stoln my <i>gods? my Teraphim</i>, <i>Gen. 31. 30.</i>
And this man <i>Michal</i> had <i>an house of gods</i>, and made an
<i>Ephod</i> and <i>Teraphim</i>, <i>Jud. 17. 5.</i> Because of the worship
exhibited to these <i>Idols</i>: Hence from the <i>Hebrew</i>
<i>Taraph</i>, as some read it, <i>Tharaph</i>, cometh the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
<i>Greek</i> θεραπεύειν, <i>To worship</i>.<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> The manner how these
<i>Images</i> were made, is fondly conceived thus among
the <i>Rabbines</i>;<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> <i>They killed a man that was a first-born
son, and wrung off his head, and seasoned it with salt,
and spices, and wrote upon a plate of gold the name of
an unclean spirit, and put it under the head upon a wall,
and lighted Candles before it, and worshipped it</i>. With
such <i>Laban</i> spake, say they. But, without controversie,
the <i>Teraphim</i> which <i>Michal</i> put in the bed, was a
<i>compleat statur, or Image of a man</i>. The use of these
<i>Images</i> was, to consult with them as with <i>Oracles</i>, concerning
things for the present unknown, or future to
come. To this purpose they were made by <i>Astrologers</i><a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a>
under certain constellations, capable of heavenly
influences, whereby they were enabled to speak. The
<i>Teraphims have spoken vanity</i>, <i>Zach. 10. 2.</i> And among
other reasons why <i>Rachel</i> stole away her Fathers Images,
this is thought to be one, that <i>Laban</i> might
not by consulting with these Images discover what
way <i>Jacob</i> took in his flight.</p>

<p>We shall find, <i>Deut. 18. 10, 11.</i> those <i>Diviners</i>,
which are by the Law forbidden, distinguished
into <i>seven kinds</i>; not because there were
no other, but they were the most usual. 1. <i>An observer
of times.</i> 2. <i>An Inchanter.</i> 3. <i>A Witch.</i>
4. <i>A Charmer.</i> 5. <i>A consulter with familiar spirits.</i> 6. <i>A
Wizard.</i> 7. A <i>Nigromancer.</i> To these we may add an
eighth, out of <i>Hos. 4. 12.</i> <i>Consulting with the staff.</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and a ninth out of <i>Ezek. 21. 21.</i> A <i>consulter with entrails</i>.
1. The first is ‎‏מעונן‏‎, an <i>observer of times</i>,<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> one
that distinguisheth times and seasons, saying <i>Such a
day is good, or such a day is naught; such an hour, such a
week, such a month is luckie, and such and such unluckie
for such and such businesses</i>: whence those<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> that derive
the word from ‎‏עין‏‎ <i>Gnajin</i>, signifying an <i>eye</i> (as
if hereby we meant a <i>Jugler, or Imposter, who deceived
the eyes of his spectators by casting a mist before them</i>)
utterly mistake: more pertinently they speak, who
derive it from ‎‏עונה‏‎ <i>Gnona</i>, signifying <i>Time</i>. But of all
I approve those who derive it<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> from ‎‏ענן‏‎ <i>Gnanan</i>,
A <i>Cloud</i>, as if the Original signified properly a <i>Planetary</i>,
or <i>Star-gazer</i>. Hereby he is distinguished from
the second sort of unlawful <i>Diviners</i>, for he also
was an Observer of times; <i>the first</i> drawing his
conclusions from the <i>colour or motion of the Clouds:
the second from his own superstitious observation of good
and evil events, happening on such and such dayes,
such and such times</i>: the <i>first</i> seemeth to have drawn
his conclusions, <i>a priori</i>, from the <i>Clouds</i> or <i>Planets,
causing good and bad events</i>: the second, <i>a posteriori,
from the events themselves, happening upon such and
such times</i>. This <i>Planetary</i>, when he observed the <i>clouds</i>,
seemeth to have stood <i>with his face Eastward, his back
Westward, his right hand towards the South, and his left
hand towards the North</i>: except it was from this positure
of the <i>Star-gazers body</i> in time of observing, I
find no reason why the <i>Hebrews</i> should term the
<i>Eastern</i> part of the world ‎‏קדים‏‎, <i>Kadim</i> i. The <i>former
part of the world</i>: the <i>Western part</i> ‎‏אחור‏‎, i. e. The
<i>back part</i>; the <i>South part</i> ‎‏ימין‏‎ <i>Jamin</i>, i. e. The <i>right
hand</i>; the <i>North part</i> ‎‏שמאל‏‎ <i>Shemol</i>, i. e. The <i>left
hand</i>. That the reason of these denominations is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
because <i>Adam</i> was created with his face toward the
<i>East</i>, is as vain, as hard to prove.</p>

it importeth rather an <i>Augur</i>, or <i>Soothsayer</i>.
The Original signifieth such an one <i>who out of his own
experience draweth observations to foretell good or evil
to come</i>, as <i>Soothsayers</i> do, by observing such and such
events, by such and such flying of Birds, screechings,
or kawings. The <i>Rabbines</i> speak in this wise:<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a>
<i>He is Menachesch, a Soothsayer, who will say, because
a morsel of bread is fallen out of his mouth, or his staff
out of his hand, or his son called him back, or a Crow kawed
unto him, or a Goat passed by him, or a Serpent was on
his right hand, or a Fox on his left hand, therefore he
will say, Do not this or that to day.</i> This word is used,
<i>Gen. 30. 27.</i> I have <i>learned by experience</i>, saith <i>Laban</i>,
that the Lord hath blessed me for thy sake. Again,
<i>Gen. 44. 5.</i> <i>Is not this the cup in which my Lord drinketh,
and whereby indeed he divineth?</i> that is, <i>proveth,
or maketh tryal or experience what manner of men ye
are</i>: The <i>Heathen</i> people were very superstitious in
these observations: Some daies were <i>Atri</i>, others <i>Albi</i>,
some <i>unlucky</i>, others <i>lucky</i>; on some daies they
accounted it unfortunate to begin battel, on some
months unfortunate to marry.</p>

<p>And as they were <i>superstitious in observing unlucky
signs</i>, so likewise in the means used to <i>avert the evil</i>
portended: the means were either <i>words</i> or <i>deeds</i>.<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a>
<i>Deeds</i>; thus if any unlucky Bird, or such like came in
their way, <i>they would fling stones at it</i>; and of this
sort is <i>the scratching of a suspected Witch</i>, which among
the simple sort of people is thought to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
means to cure <i>Witch-craft</i>. By <i>words</i>, they thought to

<p>The third is ‎‏מכשף‏‎ <i>Mecascheph</i>, <i>a Witch</i>, properly a
<i>Jugler</i>. The Original signifieth such a kind of <i>Sorcerer
who bewitcheth the senses and minds of men, by
changing the forms of things, making them appear otherwise
than indeed they are</i>. The same word is applied
to the Sorcerers in <i>Egypt</i>, who resisted <i>Moses</i> <i>Exod.
7. 11.</i> Then <i>Pharaoh</i> also called <i>Mecaschphim</i>, the Sorcerers.
Now the <i>Magicians</i> in <i>Egypt</i>; they also did
in like manner with their <i>Inchantments</i>. This latter
part of the Text explaineth what those Sorcerers
were. In that they are called <i>Magicians</i>, it implieth
their learning, that they were <i>wise men</i>, and <i>great Philosophers</i>:
the word <i>inchantments</i> declareth the <i>manner
of the delusion</i>, and it hath the signification of such a
<i>slight whereby the eyes are deluded</i>, for ‎‏להטים‏‎ <i>Lahatim</i>,
there translated <i>inchantments</i>, importeth the <i>glistering
flame of a fire or sword, wherewith the eyes of men are
dazled</i>. The <i>Greek</i> version doth not unfitly term
them φαρμακοὺς, <i>Unguentarios</i>, <i>Syplasiarios</i>, <i>Compounders
of Medicines</i>, or if you please <i>complexion-makers,<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a>
such Artisans who mask men and womens faces with
paintings and false complexions</i>. Hence it is that the
<i>Apostle</i> compareth such false teachers, <i>who under a
form and shew of godliness</i>, lead captive silly women,
to the <i>Egyptian</i> Sorcerers <i>Jannes <span class="antiqua">and</span> Jambres, who resisted
<span class="antiqua">Moses</span>,</i> <i>2 Tim. 3. 8.</i> These two were of chief note:

<p>The fourth is ‎‏חובר‏‎ <i>Chober</i>, <i>a Charmer</i>. The <i>Hebrew</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
word signifies <i>conjoyning</i> or <i>consociating</i>; either
from the league and fellowship which such persons
have with the devil, or as <i>Bodine</i> thinketh<a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> <i>because
such kind of Witches have frequent meetings, in which
they dance and make merry together</i>. <i>Onkelos</i> translateth
such a charmer ‎‏רטין‏‎ <i>Raten</i>, <i>a mutterer</i>, intimating the
manner of these Witcheries to be by the muttering,
or soft speaking of some spell or charm. The description
of a <i>Charmer</i> is thus delivered:<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> <i>He is a character
who speaketh words of a strange language, and without
sense, and he in his foolishness thinketh that these
words are profitable: that if one say so or so unto a Serpent
or Scorpion, it cannot hurt a man, and he that saith
so or so unto a man, he cannot be hurt</i>, &amp;c. <i>He that
whispereth over a wound, or readeth a verse out of the
Bible, likewise he that readeth over an Infant, that it
may not be frighted, or that layeth the book of the Law, or
the Phylacteries upon a child that it may sleep, such are
not only among Inchanters, or Charmers, but of those that
generally deny the law of God, because they make the word
of the Scripture medicine for the body, whereas they are
not, but medicine for the soul.</i> As it is written, <i>Prov. 3.
22.</i> <i>They shall be life unto thy soul</i>. Of this sort was that
whereof <i>Bodinus</i><a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> speaketh, <i>That a child by saying
a certain verse out of the Psalms, hindred a woman that
she could not make her butter; by reciting the same verse
backward, he made her butter come presently</i>.</p>

<p>The fifth, ‎‏שאל אוב‏‎ <i>Schoel Ob</i>, <i>a consulter with Ob</i>,
or <i>with familiar spirits</i>. <i>Ob</i> signifieth properly a <i>bottle</i>,
and is applied in divers places of Scripture to <i>Magicians</i>,
because they being possessed with an evil spirit,
speak with a soft and hollow voice, <i>as out of a bottle</i>.
The <i>Greek</i> calleth them Ἐγγαστριμύτης <i>Ventriloquos</i>;
<i>such whose voice seemeth to proceed out of their belly</i>.<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Such a <i>Diviner</i> was the Damosel, <i>Acts 16. 16.</i> in
St. <i>Augustines</i> judgement,<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> and is probably thought
so by most Expositors, who are of opinion, that the
<i>spirit</i> of <i>Python</i> with which this Damosel was possessed,
is the same which the <i>spirit of Ob</i> was amongst the
<i>Hebrews</i>. Hence the <i>Witch of Endor</i>, whom <i>Saul</i> requested
to raise up <i>Samuel</i>, is said in <i>Hebrew</i> to have
consulted with <i>Ob</i>; but among the <i>Latine</i> Expositors
she is commonly translated <i>Pythonissa</i>, <i>one possessed with
the spirit of Python</i>.</p>

<p>The sixth is, ‎‏ידעני‏‎ <i>Iiddegnoni</i>, a <i>Wizard</i>; in the
<i>Greek</i>, he is translated sometimes Γνώστης, a <i>cunning-man</i>.
In both Languages he had his name from <i>knowledge</i>,
which either the <i>Wizard</i> professed himself to
have, or the common people thought him to have.
The <i>Rabbies</i> say,<a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> he was so called in <i>Hebrew from a certain
beast named by them <span class="antiqua">Jadua</span>, in shape resembling
a man, because these Wizards when they did utter their
Prophecies, held a bone of this Beast between their teeth</i>.
This haply might be some <i>Diabolical Sacrament or
Ceremony</i>, used for the Confirmation of the league
between <i>Satan</i> and the <i>Wizard</i>. <i>Prophane</i> History<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a>
mentioneth Divinations of the like kind, as that
<i>Magicians</i> were wont to eat the principal parts and
members of such beasts which they deemed <i>Prophetical</i>,
thinking thereby, that by a kind of μετεμψύχωσις
the Soul of such Beasts would be conveyed into
their bodies, whereby they might be enabled for
Prophecy.</p>

<p>The seventh is ‎‏דורש אל המתים‏‎ <i>Doresch el hammethim</i>;
the <i>Greek</i> answereth word for word, ἐπερωτῶν
τοὺς νεκροὺς, <i>An enquirer of the Dead, a Necromancer</i>. Such
Diviners consulted with <i>Satan in the shape of a dead
man</i>. A memorable example we find recorded,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
<i>1 Sam. 29.</i> There, King <i>Saul</i> about to war with the
<i>Philistines</i> (God denying to answer him either by
<i>dreams</i>, or by <i>Urim</i>, or by <i>Prophets</i>) upon the fame
of the <i>Witch of Endor</i>, he repaired to her, demanding
that <i>Samuel might be raised up from the dead</i>, to tell
him the issue of the war. Now that this was not
in truth <i>Samuel</i>, is easily evinced, both by testimonies
of the learned, and reasons. <i>First</i>, it is improbable,
that God who had denied to answer him by any
<i>ordinary means</i>, should now deign him an answer so
extraordinary. <i>Secondly</i>, no Witch or Devil can disturb
the bodies or Souls of such as die in the Lord,
because they rest from their labors, <i>Rev. 14. 13.</i> <i>Thirdly</i>,
if it had been <i>Samuel</i>, he would doubtless have reproved
<i>Saul for consulting with Witches</i>.</p>

<p>The eighth is ‎‏שאל מקלו‏‎ <i>Scoel maklo</i>, <i>A Consulter
with his Staff</i>. <i>Hos. 4. 12.</i> <i>Jerome</i> saith the manner of
this divination was thus: <i>That if the doubt were between
two or three Cities, which first should be assaulted;
to determin this, they wrote the names of the Cities upon
certain staves or arrows, which being shaked in a quiver
together the first that was pulled out determined the City.</i>
Others<a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> deliver the manner of this consultation to
have been thus: <i>The consulter measured his staff by
spans or by the length of his finger, saying, as he measured,
I will go, I will not go, I will do such a thing,
I will not do it, and as the last span fell out, so he
determined</i>: This was termed by the Heathens
ῥαβδομαντεία or βελομαντεία, <i>Divination by rod or arrows</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>The ninth was ‎‏ראה בכבד‏‎ <i>Roe baccabed</i>, <i>a diviner by
intrales</i>, <i>Ezek. 22. 21.</i> <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i> being to make
war both with the <i>Jews</i>, and the <i>Ammonites</i>, and
doubting in the way, against whether of these he
should make his first on-set: First he consulted with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
his <i>Arrows and Staves</i>, of which hath been spoken
immediately before: <i>Secondly</i>, he consulted with the
<i>intrals of beasts</i>. This practice was generally received
among the <i>Heathens</i>, and because the <i>liver</i> was the
principal member observed, it was called ἡπατοσκοπία,
<i>Consultation with the liver</i>. Three things are observed
in this kind of divination. First, the colour of the
intrals, whether they were all well <i>coloured</i>. Secondly,
their <i>place</i>, whether none were <i>displaced</i>. Thirdly,
the <i>number</i>, whether none were wanting; among
those that were wanting, the want of the liver, or the
heart chiefly presaged ill: That day <i>Julius Cæsar</i> was
slain, it is storied, that in two fat Oxen then sacrificed,
the heart was wanting in them both.</p>

</div>

<p>These different Consistories, or <i>Courts</i> of Justice,
we find first distinguisht, <i>Deut. 17. 12.</i> <i>He which will
not hearken unto the Priest, nor unto the Judge</i>. Where
the people of <i>Israel</i> are directed, in what cases, and
to what persons they should make their Appeals
from inferiour <i>Courts</i>; namely, the <i>Priests</i>, <i>in matters
spiritual</i>, or <i>ceremonial</i>, and to the <i>Judges</i>, <i>in matters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
civil or criminal</i>. These two Courts are more
plainly distinguished, <i>2 Chron. 19.</i> where <i>Jehosaphat</i>,
reforming many abuses in <i>Church</i> and <i>Commonwealth</i>,
first appointed thorow-out all the fenced Cities
of <i>Judah</i>, <i>secular Judges</i> to determine criminal
causes, <i>ver. 5.</i> And at <i>Jerusalem</i> he appointed a <i>Spiritual
Court</i>, consisting of <i>Levites, Priests, and the chief
Fathers of Israel</i>, <i>vers. 8.</i> And in causes spiritual for
the Lord, <i>Amariah</i> the <i>High priest</i> was chief: in causes
criminal for the King, <i>Zebadiah</i> was chief, <i>ver. 11.</i>
Likewise the <i>Prophet Jeremiah</i> is condemned to die
by the <i>Consistory of Priests</i>, <i>Jer. 26. 8.</i> But by the
<i>Consistory of Princes, or secular Judges sitting in the
gate</i>, he was absolved and discharged, <i>vers. 16.</i> Yea,
although the tyranny of <i>Antiochus</i>, and the troublesome
times insuing had bred such a confusion in matters
of Government among the <i>Jews</i>, that an evident
distinction can hardly be found in the <i>New-Testament</i>,
yet some foot-steps, and imperfect tokens of both
Courts are there observable, principally, <i>Matth. 21.
23.</i> <i>It.</i> <i>Matth. 26. 3.</i> The <i>Chief Priests</i> and the <i>Elders</i>,
of the people, are named as two distinct <i>Consistories</i>:
and each Consistory seemeth to be differenced by
its proper name: The <i>secular Consistory</i> termed συνέδριον,
A <i>Councel</i>: the <i>spiritual</i> termed συναγωγὴ, <i>a Synagogue</i>.
<i>They will deliver you up to the Councels, and they
will scourge you in their Synagogues</i>, <i>Matth. 10. 17.</i>
Hence that great Assembly of <i>Prophets</i> and holy men
called together by <i>Esra</i>, for the reformation of the
<i>Church</i>, after their return from <i>Babylon</i>, is called <i>Synagoga
magna</i>, <i>A great Synagogue</i>.</p>

<p>The Office of the <i>Ecclesiastical Court</i>, was to put
a difference between things <i>holy</i> and <i>unholy</i>, and between
<i>clean</i> and <i>unclean</i>, <i>Levit. 10. 10.</i> and to <i>determine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Appeals in controversies of difficulty</i>. It was a <i>representative
Church</i>. Hence is that <i>Dic Ecclesiæ</i>, <i>Mat.
18. 16.</i> <i>Tell the Church</i>, because unto them belonged
the <i>power of Excommunication</i>, the several sorts of
which censure follow in the next Chapter.</p>

<p>Only here take notice, that as in the <i>Civil Consistories</i>,
consisting of <i>seventy Judges</i>, which was the supreme
Court, there were two sate as Chief; namely,
one whom they termed <i>Nasi</i>, <i>The Lord Chief Justice</i>;
and the other whom they termed <i>Abbeth din</i>, the <i>Father
of the Senate</i>: so in the <i>Ecclesiastical Consistory</i>
the <i>High-priest</i> and his <i>Sagan</i>, or <i>second High priest</i>
sate chief there, <i>2 King. 23. 4.</i> That the <i>High priest</i>
sate in the <i>Sanhedrim</i> necessarily, is an errour;<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> for he
was not elected into that Company, except he were
a man of extraordinary wisdome. Again, note, that
sometimes both <i>Consistories</i> assembled together, as
often as the matters to be determined were partly
<i>ceremonial</i>, partly <i>civil</i>, partly belonging to the
<i>Church</i>, partly to the <i>Commonwealth</i>: which being
not noted, causeth the Courts not to be distinguished
by many Expositors. This meeting and joyning of
both <i>Consistories</i> often appeareth in the <i>Gospel</i>. The
<i>chief Priests</i> and <i>Elders</i> meet together.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_II">CHAP. II.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Of their Excommunication.</i></span></h3>

<p>They had three <i>Degrees of Excommunication</i>.
The first was called in the <i>N. T.</i> <i>a casting out
of the Synagogue</i>, <i>John 9. 22.</i> by the <i>Jews</i><a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> <i>Niddui</i>
i. <i>a separation</i> or <i>putting away</i>. It signified<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> <i>a separation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
from all commerce or society either with man or
woman</i> for the distance of <i>four Cubits</i>; also <i>from eating
or drinking with any; from the use of the marriage-bed,
from shaving, washing, or the like</i>, according to
the pleasure of the <i>Judge</i>, and the quality of the offence.
It was of force 30 days, yet so that they might
be shortened upon repentance. He that was thus <i>excommunicated</i>,
had power to <i>be present at divine service,
to teach others, and learn of others; he hired servants,
and was hired himself</i>, but always on condition
of the aforesaid <i>separation</i>. If he remained impenitent,
according to the pleasure of the Judge, his punishment
was increased, either to the doubling or the
tripling of the time, or to the extending of it to their
lives end; his male-children were not circumcised;
if he died without repentance, then, by the sentence
of the Judge, a stone was cast upon his Coffin or Bier,
to shew that he was worthy to be stoned. They
mourned not for such a one with solemn lamentation,
they followed him not unto the grave, nor buried
him with common burial.</p>

<p>The second was called in the <i>N. T.</i> <i>a giving one over
to Satan</i>, <i>1 Cor. 5. 5.</i> By the <i>Jews</i> ‎‏חרם‏‎ <i>Cherem</i>. For the
better understanding of this word, we must know that
it is not used in this sense in the <i>Old Testament</i>; there
we shall find it applied to <i>persons</i>, or to <i>things</i>; if to
<i>persons</i>, then it signifieth <i>a devotion of them to God by
their death</i>, <i>Levit. 27. 29.</i> If to <i>things</i>, then it signifieth
<i>a devotion of them unto God</i>, by separating them from
ordinary use. Hence it is that <i>Achan</i> is punisht for
stealing the <i>devoted</i> thing, <i>Josh. 7.</i> <i>Persons</i> thus <i>devoted</i>,
were termed by the <i>Greeks</i> ἀναθέματα; and <i>devoted
things</i>, ἀναθήματα.<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> Notwithstanding, in the <i>Apostles</i>
time, both <i>Cherem</i> and ἀνάθεμα, signified a <i>second degree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
of Excommunication</i>, differing from the former.
First because it was not done in a <i>private Court</i>, but
published in the audience of the <i>whole Church</i>: Secondly,
maledictions and curses were added out of
the Law of <i>Moses</i>, At the publishing hereof Candles
were kindled; and when the curses were ended, they
put out the candles, in token that the excommunicate
person was <i>deprived of the light of heaven</i>. This kind
of <i>excommunication</i> was exercised against the <i>incestuous
person</i>, and against <i>Hymenæus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> and <i>Alexander</i>.<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></p>

<p>The third was called in the <i>New Test.</i> by the <i>Syriack</i>
name <i>Maranatha</i>, <i>1 Cor. 16.</i> that is, <i>the Lord cometh</i>;
<i>Maran</i> signifieth <i>the Lord</i>, and <i>Atha</i> <i>cometh</i> and this
they say was instituted by <i>Enoch</i>, <i>Judg. 11.</i> The <i>Jews</i>
called it <i>Schammatha</i>, the Etymology of which word
I find to be twofold. Some say<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> it soundeth as much
as <i>Maran Atha</i> <i>the Lord cometh</i>. <i>Schem</i> signifieth
the <i>Lord</i>, and <i>Atha</i> <i>cometh</i>: others say<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> it soundeth
<i>there is death</i>, <i>Schem</i> signifying <i>there</i> and <i>Mitha</i> <i>death</i>.
Hence we may render it an <i>excommunication to death</i>.
And this is thought<a name="FNanchor_526" id="FNanchor_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> to be the reason of that phrase,
<i>1 John 5. 16.</i> <i>There is a sin unto death</i>, i. which deserveth
<i>excommunication to death</i>. <i>R. Gersom</i><a name="FNanchor_527" id="FNanchor_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a> forbade
the breaking open of letters, under the penalty of all
three sorts of <i>excommunication</i>. And this was termed
<i>Excommunicatio in secreto nominis tetragrammati</i>: see
the form thereof in the <i>Chapter of the Sadduces</i>.</p>

<p>In the <i>Greek Church</i> there were<a name="FNanchor_528" id="FNanchor_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> <i>four degrees of
this censure</i>. 1. Σύστασις. Those were censured with this
<i>degree</i>, who were only <i>debarred the Lords Table</i>: as for
enterance into the <i>Church</i>, hearing the Word, praying
with the Congregations, they enjoyed equal liberty
with <i>other Christians</i>, they might stand by and behold
others receive the <i>Sacrament</i>, but themselves did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
partake thereof, whence they were called <i>Stantes</i>.
2. ὑπόπτωσις, concerning this censure, all that I read
of it is thus; that he that is <i>thus censured</i> hath admittance
into the Church.<a name="FNanchor_529" id="FNanchor_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> But his place must be
<i>behind the Pulpit</i>, and he must depart with the <i>Catechumeni</i>,
that is such <i>Pagans</i> who were gained to the
<i>Christian Faith</i>, but not fully admitted into the
<i>Church</i>, because they wanted Baptism, and therefore
that they might not pray promiscuously with other
<i>Christians</i>, there was a place behind the <i>Quire of the
Church</i> in manner of Cloysters, allotted to them, and
was from them called <i>Catechumenum</i>:<a name="FNanchor_530" id="FNanchor_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> This I take
to be the place of this <i>second degree of Excommunication</i>,
so that the force of this censure I think to
consist in these three things. First, they were <i>barred
the Lords Table</i>. Secondly, they might <i>not stand by at the
administration of the Lords supper</i> (which was allowed
in the first degree) and this appeareth clearly, because
the <i>Catechumeni departed always at the celebration
of the Communion</i>, for to them principally it was
said, <i>Ite missa est</i>. Thirdly, though they might ὑποπεσεῖν
<i>fall down on their knees and pray</i>, and were thence
called <i>Succumbents</i>, yet this they might not do in the
Congregation, but only in that place <i>behind the quire
or pulpit</i>, which was allotted to the <i>Catechumeni</i>, and
in this also this <i>second degree</i> differeth from the <i>first</i>.
The third sort of censure was ἀκρόασις, the party thus
censured was permitted to come no further than the
<i>Church Porch</i>, where it was lawful for him to hear
the Scriptures read, but not to joyn in prayer, not to
approach the <i>Lords Table</i>, whence such were termed
<i>Audients</i>. The Fourth, and last sort, was πρόκλαυσις,
persons under this censure stood quite without the
Church, requesting those that entered in, with tears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
and weeping to petition the <i>Lord</i> for mercy toward
them, whence they were called <i>Plorantes</i>.</p>

<p>Seeing it is commonly thought, that <i>Cain</i> was censured
by the first degree of <i>Excommunication</i>, called
<i>Niddui</i>, and that the last called <i>Schammmatha</i> was of
<i>Enochs constitution</i>; both these being of such antiquity,
I dare not say that the <i>three degrees of Excommunication</i>
were borrowed from the <i>three sorts of uncleanness</i>,
which excluded people out of the <i>three
Camps</i>, though there was an observable proportion
between them.<a name="FNanchor_531" id="FNanchor_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> <i>Niddui</i> may be parrallel’d with the
exclusion out of the <i>Camp of God alone</i>, which befel
those that were defiled by touch of the dead: <i>Cherem</i>
may be compared to the exclusion out of the <i>Camp
of God, and the Camp of Levi</i>, which befel those that
were defiled of an issue. <i>Schammatha</i> may be compared
with the exclusion out of <i>all three Camps, the
Camp of God, the Camp of Levi, and the Camp of Israel</i>,
this befel those that were defiled with leprosie;
and from the <i>Jews</i>, it is probable that the <i>Greek</i> and
<i>Latine Churches</i> borrowed their <i>degrees of Excommunication</i>.</p>

<p>In many things men might be sinful in respect of
<i>Gods Law</i>, though not liable to punishment, in respect
of mans; <i>thou shalt not avenge, nor be mindful
of wrong</i>, <i>Levit. 19. 18.</i> which the <i>Hebrews</i> explain
thus, <i>To avenge</i>, is to deny a good turn to one who
formerly denied him. To <i>be mindful of a wrong</i>, is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
do a good turn to one who formerly would not do
so much for him; but at the doing thereof, to upbraid
the other of his unkindness. They illustrate
it thus: when <i>Reuben</i> said to <i>Simeon</i>, Lend me thy
Hatchet; he answereth, I will not lend him: Afterward
<i>Simeon</i> had need to borrow an Hatchet of <i>Reuben</i>,
and saith unto him, lend me thy Hatchet: <i>Reuben</i>
saith unto him, I will not lend him, thou wouldst
not lend me thine: this is ‎‏נקימה‏‎ <i>Nekima</i>, <i>Avengement</i>.
Now when <i>Reuben</i> saith to <i>Simeon</i>, Lend me
thy Hatchet: he answereth, I will not lend him: afterwards
<i>Simeon</i> borroweth a Hatchet of <i>Reuben</i>:
<i>Reuben</i> saith, lo, I will lend it thee, I will not deal
with thee as thou dealedst with me, this is ‎‏נטירה‏‎
<i>Netira</i>, <i>Mindfulness</i>: both these were sinful, but not
liable to mans judgment.</p>

<p>In all civil Courts, five sorts of persons were alwayes
present. 1. <i>Judges.</i> 2. <i>Officers.</i> 3. <i>Pleaders.</i>
4. <i>Notaries.</i> 5. <i>Witnesses.</i> In the <i>supreme Court</i>, there
was one that was chief over all the other <i>Judges</i>,
they called him in <i>Hebrew</i> <i>Nasi</i>, in <i>Greek</i> ἄρχοντα, <i>The
Prince</i>. His leave was craved for the tryal of actions.
The <i>Witnesses</i> were at least two, <i>Deut. 29. 15.</i> If they
were false, they punish’d them with a <i>Talio</i>, the same
punishment which he intended against his brother,
<i>Deut. 19. 19.</i> The <i>Notaries</i> were two,<a name="FNanchor_532" id="FNanchor_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> one stood on
the <i>right hand to write the sentence of Absolution</i>, and
what was spoken in defence of the party; the other
stood on the <i>left hand, to write the sentence of condemnation</i>,
and the objections against the party. <i>Drusius</i><a name="FNanchor_533" id="FNanchor_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a>
thinks that <i>Christ</i> speaking of the last Judgment
had reference to this, <i>He shall set the sheep on the right
hand, and on the left the goats</i>, <i>Matth. 25. 23.</i> The <i>Officers</i>
were in manner of <i>Sheriffs</i>, they were present to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
execute what the <i>Judges</i> determined; whence they
carried up and down their <i>staves</i> and <i>whips</i>,<a name="FNanchor_534" id="FNanchor_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a> as
the <i>Consuls</i> of <i>Rome</i> had <i>Rod</i> and <i>Axes</i>, carried before
them for the readier execution of justice. In <i>Hebrew</i>
they are called ‎‏שוטרים‏‎ <i>Schoterim</i>, by the Septuagint
sometimes γραμματεῖς, in our <i>English</i> translation
commonly <i>Officers</i>, and by Saint <i>Luke</i> πράκτορες: for,
doubtless there is allusion unto them, <i>Luke 12. 58.</i>
When thou goest with thine adversary, (ἄρχοντι) to
the <i>Magistrate</i>, as thou art in the way, give diligence
that thou maist be delivered from him, lest he hale
thee to the <i>Judge</i>, and the <i>Judge</i> deliver thee to the
<i>Officer</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> The <i>Pleader</i> was called ‎‏בעל ריב‏‎ <i>Baal rib</i>,
he stood on the <i>right hand</i> of the party cited into the
<i>Court</i>, whether he pleaded for or against him. The
<i>Lord</i> shall stand on the right hand of the poor, to
save him from those that judge his soul, <i>Psa. 109. 31.</i>
that is, <i>The Lord shall plead his cause</i>. And <i>Satan</i> stood
at the <i>right hand of</i> Joshua, <i>Zach. 3. 1.</i> that is <i>to accuse
him, or plead against him</i>. When S. <i>John</i> speaking, <i>If
any man sin, we have an Advocate</i>, <i>1 John 2. 1.</i> he alludeth
unto this <i>Baalrib</i>, or <i>Pleader</i>. The <i>Judges</i>, they examined
and determin’d matters and after examination,
sentence was pronounced by the <i>Judge</i> in this
manner: <i>Tu N. justus, Tu. N. reus</i>, <i>Thou <span class="antiqua">Simon</span> art just:
Thou <span class="antiqua">Reuben</span> art guilty</i>: at the pronunciation of which
the guilty person was dragged to the place of execution.
<i>When he shall be judged, let him be condemned</i>,
<i>Ps. 109. 7.</i> the <i>Hebrew</i> is, <i>Let him go out wicked</i>.</p>

<p>The manner of sentencing persons, varied in most
Countries. The <i>Jews</i> by a simple pronunciation of
sentence, both absolved men, and condemned them.
The <i>Romans</i><a name="FNanchor_535" id="FNanchor_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> gave sentence by calling in Tables into
a certain box or urne prepared for the purpose:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
if they absolved any, they wrote the letter <i>A</i> in the table,
it being the first letter of <i>Absolvo</i>: if they would
condemn any, they cast in a table with <i>C</i> written in
it, which is the first letter of <i>Condemno</i>: if the matter
were hard to determine, they would cast in other tables
with <i>N L</i>, signifying <i>Non Liquet</i>. The <i>Græcians</i><a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>
in like manner used three letters: Θ was a token
of <i>condemnation</i>, which occasioned that of <i>Persius</i>.</p>

of their Fence-Schools, where the set posture of the

<span class="smaller"><i>The number of their Civil Courts.</i></span></h3>

<p>Their Civil Courts were two, ‎‏סנהדרים גדולה‏‎
<i>Sanhedrim gedola</i>, <i>the great Consistory</i>, or <i>Supreme
Senate</i>, ‎‏סנהדרים קטנה‏‎ <i>Sanhedrim Ketanna</i>, <i>the
lesser and inferiour Court</i>. Thus I find them divided
generally by the <i>Rabbins</i>: And although the latter
was subdivided, as will after appear; yet in old
time there were onely two first branches: which division
our <i>Saviour Christ</i> seemeth to have followed,
calling the lesser Court κρίσιν, by the name of <i>Judgement</i>:
the greater συνέδριον, by the name of a <i>Counsel</i>.
Whosoever is angry with his brother unadvisedly,
shall be culpable of <i>Judgement</i>. Whosoever saith
unto his brother <i>Raca</i>, shall be worthy to be punished
by the <i>Counsel</i>: Whosoever shall say <i>Fool</i>, shall
be worthy to be punished with the <i>fire of Gehenna</i>,
<i>Mat. 5. 22.</i> In which words, as there is a <i>gradation of sin</i>,
1. <i>Anger</i>, a passion of the mind. 2. <i>Raca</i>,<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> scornful,
or slighting speech, as <i>Tut, Tush, &amp;c.</i> 3. <i>Fool</i>, reproachful
and opprobrious names: so likewise
there is a <i>gradation of punishment</i>. 1. <i>Judgement</i>, a
lesser Court. 2. <i>Councel</i>, the greater Court. 3. The
<i>fire of Gehenna</i>: Now <i>Gehenna</i> was a Valley, terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
for two sorts of fires in it: First, for that wherein
men burnt their children unto <i>Moloch</i>.<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> Secondly,
for another fire there continually burning, to consume
the dead carcasses, and filth of <i>Jerusalem</i>; partly
for the terribleness of the first, and partly for the
contemptibleness of the place by reason of the second
fire, it was a <i>type of hell fire it self</i>. We may resolve that
text thus, <i>anger</i> deserved the punishments of the <i>lesser
Court</i>; <i>Raca</i>, the punishments of the <i>greater</i>: and
<i>Fool</i> deserved punishments beyond all Courts, even
the <i>fire of</i> Gehenna.</p>

<p>The <i>greater Court</i>, by way of excellency, was called
the <i>Sanhedrim</i>, which word came from the <i>Greek</i>, συνέδριον,
<i>a place of Judgement</i>: It was also called ‎‏בית דין‏‎
<i>Beth din</i>, <i>the house of Judgment</i>.<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> It was distinguished
from the other <i>Courts</i>; first, in respect of the number
of the <i>Judges</i>, which were <i>seventy one</i>, according to
the command of <i>God</i> to <i>Moses</i> at their first institution,
<i>Numb. 11. 16.</i> <i>Gather unto me <span class="antiqua">seventy</span> men of the

words of this Text, it is observed, that there were <i>seventy</i>
besides <i>Moses</i>; and therefore after his decease
they alwaies chose one <i>chief Judge</i> in his room, not
reckoning him among the <i>seventy</i>; they called him
<i>Nasi</i>, the <i>Prince</i> or <i>chief over the seventy</i>. These <i>seventy</i>
are thought<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a> to be chosen <i>six</i> out of every
<i>Tribe</i>, save the <i>Tribe of Levi</i>, out of which only <i>four</i>
were chosen. Others think<a name="FNanchor_541" id="FNanchor_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> the manner of their
choice was thus; six of every Tribe had their names
written in little scrolls of paper: in <i>seventy</i> of these
scrolls was written ‎‏זקן‏‎ <i>Zaken</i>, <i>Senex</i>, <i>an Elder</i>, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
two other ‎‏חלק‏‎ <i>Cheleck</i>, <i>pars</i>, <i>A part</i>; these scrolls they
put into a pitcher or urn, and those that pluck’d out
a scroll wherein <i>Elder</i> was written, were counted amongst
the number of the <i>Judges</i>; those that pluck’d
out the other scrolls, in which a <i>Part</i> was written,
they were rejected, <i>Numb. 11. 26.</i> The senior of these
<i>seventy</i> was called ‎‏אב בית דין‏‎ <i>Ab beth din</i>, the <i>Father
of the Judgment Hall</i>. The whole Set<a name="FNanchor_542" id="FNanchor_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> or <i>Bench of
Judges</i>, sate in manner of an half circle, the <i>Nasi</i> sitting
in the midst above the rest, the other sitting
round about beneath, in such manner that the <i>Father
of the Judgement Hall</i> sate next to the <i>Nasi</i> on the
right hand. The <i>lesser Consistory</i> was subdivided into
two sorts, one consisted of <i>twenty three Aldermen</i>, and
two such <i>Consistories</i> there were in <i>Jerusalem</i>, the one
at the <i>door of the Court before the Temple</i>, the other at
the <i>door of the Mountain of the Temple</i>: yea, in every
City throughout <i>Israel</i> where there were sixscore
housholders, such a Consistory was erected: the other
sort of <i>lesser Courts</i> consisted only of a <i>Triumvirate</i>,
<i>three Aldermen</i>; and this was erected in the
lesser Cities, which had not the number of sixscore
housholders.</p>

<p>The second difference<a name="FNanchor_543" id="FNanchor_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> between the <i>greater Consistory</i>
and the <i>lesser</i>, was in respect of the place. The
<i>seventy</i> sate only at <i>Jerusalem</i>, within the <i>Court of the
Temple</i>, in a certain house called ‎‏לשכת הגזית‏‎ <i>Lischath
hegazith</i>, <i>the paved Chamber</i>, because of the curious
cut stones wherewith it was <i>paved</i>: by the
<i>Greeks</i> it was called λιθόστρωτον, the <i>Pavement</i>. <i>Pilate</i>
sat down in the Judgement Seat, in a place called the
<i>Pavement</i>, <i>John 19. 13.</i> The other Consistory sate all
in the <i>gates of the Cities</i>. Now because the gates of
the City are the strength thereof, and in their gates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
their Judges sate: Hence is that, <i>Mat. 16. 18.</i> <i>The
gates of Hell</i> shall not overcome it, that is, neither the
<i>strength</i> nor <i>policy</i> of <i>Satan</i>.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Lastly</i>, they differed in respect of their <i>Power</i> and
<i>Authority</i>: the <i>Consistory of seventy</i> received <i>appeals</i>
from the other <i>inferiour Courts</i>,<a name="FNanchor_544" id="FNanchor_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> from that there was
no appeal: Again, the <i>Consistory of three</i> sate not on
life and death, but onely on petty matters, as whipping,
pecuniary controversies, and such like; the
other of twenty three sate on life and death, but with
a restrained power; they had not authority to judge
an <i>whole tribe, the High-priest, false Prophets</i>, and other
such weighty matters: this belonged only to the <i>seventy
in Jerusalem</i>:<a name="FNanchor_545" id="FNanchor_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> Hence is that, <i>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
which killest the Prophets</i>, <i>Luk. 3. 34.</i> The means
how they tryed the false <i>Prophet</i> was thus; they observed
the judgements which he threatned, and the <i>good</i>
which he prophesied to a place: if the judgements
took not effect, this did not argue him a <i>false Prophet</i>,
because God was merciful, as in the case of <i>Hezekiah</i>,
and the people might repent, as the <i>Ninivites</i>
did: but if he prophesied <i>good</i>, and that came not
to pass, they judged him a <i>false Prophet</i>. The ground
of this tryal they make the words of <i>Jeremiah the
Prophet, which prophesied of peace when the word of the
Lord shall come to pass, then shall the Prophet be known
that the Lord hath truly sent him</i>, <i>Jer. 28. 9.</i></p>

<p>Here some may object, that there were no such
<i>Courts</i>, or their liberty much infringed in <i>Samuels
time</i>: for he went from year to year in circuit to <i>Bethel</i>,
and <i>Gilgal</i>, and <i>Mizpeh</i>, <i>and judged Israel in all
those places</i>, <i>1 Sam. 7. 16.</i> To which, I take it, we may
say, that as the <i>Emperours</i> of <i>Rome</i> had power to ride
Circuits, and keep Assises, which was done without
any infringement of the liberties of their <i>Senate</i>: So
the <i>Kings</i> and <i>Judges</i> in <i>Israel</i> had the like power, and
yet the authority of their Courts stood firm. This
kind of judging by keeping Assises, the <i>Romans</i> termed
βουλὴν κυρίαν, the other βουλὴν σύγκλητον.</p>

<p>Their <i>Inauguration of Judges was two fold</i>: At first,
by <i>imposition of hands</i> upon the head of the party, after
the example of <i>Moses</i> laying hands on <i>Joshua</i>: this <i>imposition
of hands</i> was not held lawful,<a name="FNanchor_552" id="FNanchor_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> except it
were in the presence of five or three <i>Judges</i> at the
least. Afterwards, it was by <i>saying a certain verse</i><a name="FNanchor_553" id="FNanchor_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a>
Lo, <i>thou art associated, and power is given thee to judge

nomine tantum</i>.</p>

<p>Observe here, that <i>Samuc</i>, which I render <i>associated</i>,
doth not alwayes signifie a man licensed to the
discharge of some publik office by the <i>imposition of
hands</i>; for here it is applied to those who were <i>not
admitted by imposition of hands</i>. Now the reason why
these words <i>Semica</i>, and <i>Semicuth</i>, are generally by
all Expositors, <i>Jews</i> and <i>Christians</i>, translated the
<i>imposition of hands</i>, is, because this solemn kind of licensing,
termed <i>Semica</i>, or <i>Semicuth</i>, was in old time
used only towards two sorts of men in their admission,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
towards <i>Rabbies</i> and towards <i>Judges</i>; which kind
of permission, because it was not performed towards
either of them without this ceremony of <i>imposing
hands</i>: hence these two words have been translated
the <i>imposition of hands</i>; whereas properly they signifie
nothing else, but <i>an association, an approximation,
or conjoyning of one into the same corporation or company,
of which he that doth associate and give admission
is a member</i>.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_VI">CHAP. VI.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Ceremonies common in all capital Judgments.</i></span></h3>

<p>In their greater punishments, which deprived of
life, some <i>ceremonies</i> were <i>common</i> to them all.</p>

<p>First, <i>The Judges were to use deliberation in all causes</i>,
but especially in matters capital. There were four
causes, saith <i>Jonathan</i> in his <i>Targum</i>,<a name="FNanchor_554" id="FNanchor_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> that came
before <i>Moses</i> ( he mentioneth none in particular, but
what they were, we shall presently learn out of other
records.) <i>Two</i> of these were not <i>weighty</i>; in these he
<i>hastened</i>: <i>Two more material</i>, concerning life and
death; in these he delayed.<a name="FNanchor_555" id="FNanchor_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a> <i>Cæterum tam de his
quam de illis dicebat, Non audivi</i>; <i>Of both the lighter
and weightier causes, <span class="antiqua">Moses</span> said I have not heard</i>, to
wit, from the <i>Lord:</i> to shew, that a deliberation and
consultation as it were with God, ought to be in all
<i>judgements</i>, before sentence be pronounced. These
four causes are named in other <i>Records</i>:<a name="FNanchor_556" id="FNanchor_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> The <i>two
lightest are</i>, 1. <i>The matter of uncleanness debarring the
people from the Passover</i>, <i>Num. 9. 9.</i> Secondly, <i>the case
of <span class="antiqua">Zelophehads</span> daughters</i>, <i>Num. 36. 10.</i> <i>The 2 weightier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
are</i>, 1. <i>The cause of the blasphemer</i>, <i>Lev. 24. 13.</i> <i>Secondly,
The case of him that gathered Sticks on the Sabbath</i>,
<i>Numb. 15. 35.</i> In all these judgments there is, <i>The Lord
spake unto Moses</i>. And in the first, which was counted
among the lighter causes (because it was not on life
and death) even there doth <i>Moses</i> in a solemn manner
bespeak the people to stand still, <i>Et ego audiam</i>,
<i>And I will hear what the Lord will command</i>. Notwithstanding,
<i>wilful delays in Justice</i> maketh the <i>Judge
unrighteous</i>. In that <i>unrighteous Judge</i>, from whom
the Widow wrested sentence by importunity; we
read not of any other fault in him, but delay, <i>Luke
18. 6.</i></p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, The party accused was placed on some
<i>high place</i>, from whence he might be seen and heard
of all the people: <i>Set Naboth</i>, <i>in capite populi</i>, <i>on high
among the people</i>, <i>1 Kings 21. 9.</i></p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>,<a name="FNanchor_557" id="FNanchor_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> The <i>Judges</i> and the <i>Witnesses</i> did (when
sentence was pronounced) put their hands upon the
condemned persons head, and said; <i>Sanguis tuus super
caput tuum</i>, <i>Thy blood be upon thine own head</i>: unto this
the people had reference, saying, <i>His blood be on us,

<p><i>Fourthly</i>, The place of execution was <i>without the

termed by the <i>Rabbines</i><a name="FNanchor_558" id="FNanchor_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> ‎‏חזני הכנסת‏‎ <i>Chazani

</div>

<p><i>Fifthly</i>, When the malefactor was led to execution,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
a <i>publick cryer</i> went before,<a name="FNanchor_560" id="FNanchor_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> saying, <i>Such a one is
going to be punisht with such a death, because he hath
committed such, or such an offence, at such a time, in such
a place; and these <span class="antiqua">N. N.</span> are witnesses thereof: If any
therefore knoweth any thing which may do him good, let
him come and make it known</i>. For this purpose one
was appointed to stand at the door of the Consistory,
with an handkerchief or linnen cloth in his hand, that
if any person should come for his defence, he at the
door swinged about his handkerchief, upon the sight
whereof, another standing in readiness a pretty distance
off with an horse, hastened and called back the
condemned person: yea, if the Malefactor had any
further plea for his own purgation, he might come
back four or five times, except he spake vainly; for
the discerning whereof, two of those whom they
termed <i>Scholars of the wise men</i>, were sent with him
to observe his speech on the way.</p>

<div class="footnote">

</div>

<p><i>Sixthly</i>, He was exhorted to <i>confess</i>, that he might
have his portion in the world to come: Thus <i>Joshua</i>
exhorted <i>Achan</i>, <i>Josh. 7. 19.</i> <i>My son, give I pray thee
glory unto the Lord God of Israel, and make confession
unto him</i>: unto whom <i>Achan</i> answered, <i>vers. 20.</i> <i>Indeed
I have sinned against the Lord God of Israel, and
thus have I done</i>.</p>

<p><i>Seventhly</i>, In the time of execution, they gave the
Malefactor <i>Granum thuris in calice vini</i>, <i>A grain of
Frankincense in a cup of Wine</i>:<a name="FNanchor_561" id="FNanchor_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> this they did give to
cause a giddiness in the condemned persons head,
that thereby he might be less sensible of the pain. St.
<i>Mark</i> calleth this cup ἐσμυρνισμένον οἶνον, <i>Wine mingled
with Myrrhe</i>, Mark 15. 23. This was done after the
<i>manner of the Jews</i>, but the <i>Souldiers in mockery</i> mingled
Vinegar and Gall with it, <i>Mat. 27. 34.</i> As likewise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
they gave him a second cup in <i>derision</i>, when
they took a spunge, and filled it with Vinegar, and
put it on a reed, <i>Matth. 27. 48.</i> S. <i>Mark</i> in the first cup
mentioneth the custome of the <i>Jews</i>, which in it self
had some shew of compassion; for the ground of this
custom was taken from that, <i>Prov. 31. 6.</i> <i>Give strong
drink unto him that is ready to perish</i>. S. <i>Matthew</i> mentioneth
onely their wicked mixture, contrary to the
<i>receiv’d custom</i>; so that one Evangelist must expound
the other. This first <i>cup</i> was so usually given before
execution, that the word <i>Calix</i> <i>a cup</i>, is sometimes in
the Scripture put for <i>death it self</i>. <i>Father, if it may be,
let this cup pass from me.</i></p>

in use among them. 1. <i>Lapidatio</i>,<a name="FNanchor_564" id="FNanchor_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> stoning.
2. <i>Combustio</i>,<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> burning. 3. <i>Decollatio</i>,<a name="FNanchor_566" id="FNanchor_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> beheading.
4. <i>Suffocatio</i>,<a name="FNanchor_567" id="FNanchor_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> strangling. Of these, <i>stoning was counted

saith of an offender, <i>Morte plectetur</i>, <i>he shall be
punish’d with death</i>, not expressing the kind of death,
there it ought to be interpreted of <i>Strangling</i>. For
example, the Law saith of the Adulterer, <i>Lev. 20. 19.</i>
<i>Morte plectatur</i>, <i>let him be punished with death</i>: because
the kind of death is not here mentioned, they
interpret it <i>strangling</i>. The reason of this rule is, because
strangling was the easiest death of the four; and
where the Law determineth not the punishment,
there they say, <i>Ampliandi favores</i>, The favourablest
exposition is to be given.</p>

Omnis mors

</div>

<p>The rule is not generally true; for in former times
<i>Adultery was punish’d with stoning</i>. I will judge thee
after the manner of them that are <i>Harlots</i>, saith the
<i>Lord</i>, <i>Ezek. 16. 38.</i> And in the fortieth verse the judgment
is named, <i>They shall stone thee with stones</i>: likewise
the <i>Scribes</i> and <i>Pharisees</i> said unto Christ, <i>Moses</i>
in the Law commanded us, that such should be stoned,
<i>John 8.</i></p>

<p>Before we treat in particular of these four punishments
it may be questioned, <i>Whether the Jews had any
power to judge of life and death, at that time when
they crucified our blessed Saviour?</i> The <i>Jews said to <span class="antiqua">Pilate</span>,
Is it not lawful for us to put any man to death</i>; <i>Joh.
18. 31.</i> Latter <i>Jews</i> say<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> that <i>all power of capital
punishments was taken from them forty years before the
destruction of the second Temple</i>, and of this opinion
are many <i>Divines</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_569" id="Footnote_569"></a><a href="#FNanchor_569"><span class="label">[569]</span></a> <i>Moses Kotsen.
in Sanhedrim.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Answer.</i> First, the <i>Jews</i> speech unto <i>Pilate</i>, that it
was not lawful for them to put any man to death,
cannot be understood, as if they should have said, we
have no power to put any man to death; for admit,
that power in criminals were, in the <i>general</i>, taken
from them, yet in this <i>particular</i> power was permitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
them at that time from <i>Pilate</i>, <i>Take ye him, and
judge him according to your Law</i>, <i>Joh. 18. 31.</i> Neither
can it be said, that their Law could not condemn
him, if he had been a transgressor thereof; or that
they had not out of their law to object against him:
for they say, <i>They had a law, and by their law he ought
to die</i>, <i>John 19. 7.</i> It was not then want of <i>Power</i>, but
the <i>holiness of that time</i>, made them say <i>it was unlawful</i>.
For they held it <i>unlawful</i> upon their <i>days of preparation</i>
to sit on life and death, as hath been shewn in
the <i>Chapter of translating Feasts</i>. And <i>Friday</i>, on
which our <i>Saviour</i> was condemned, was the <i>preparation
of their Sabbath</i>.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, in the questions, whether power of judging
capital crimes were taken from them by the <i>Romans</i>?
We are to distinguish between <i>crimes</i>. <i>Some
crimes were transgressions of the Romans law</i>, as theft,
murder, robberies, <i>&amp;c.</i> power of judging in these
was taken from them: <i>other crimes were transgressions
only against the law of Moses</i>, as blasphemy, and the
like: in these, power of judging seemeth to have
remained with them. When <i>Paul</i> was brought by
the <i>Jews</i> before <i>Gallio</i>, <i>Gallio</i> said unto them, if it
were a matter of <i>wrong</i> or <i>wicked lewdness</i>, O ye <i>Jews</i>,
reason would, that I should bear with you: but if it
be a <i>question of words</i>, and <i>names of your law</i>, look ye
to it, <i>Acts 18. 14.</i></p>

<p>In handling these four punishments: First observe
the <i>offenders</i>, whom the <i>Jews</i> make liable to each punishment,
and then the <i>manner of the punishment</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>persons</i> to be <i>stoned</i> were <i>eighteen</i>.<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> 1. <i>He that
lieth with his own mother</i>, 2. <i>Or with his fathers wife</i>,
3. <i>Or with his daughter-in-law</i>, 4. <i>Or with a betrothed
maid</i>, 4. <i>Or with the male</i>, 6. <i>Or with the beast</i>. 7. <i>The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
woman that lieth down to a beast.</i> 8. <i>The blasphemer.</i>
9. <i>He that worshippeth an Idol.</i> 10. <i>He that offereth of his
seed to Moloch.</i> 11. <i>He that hath a familiar spirit.</i> 12.
<i>The Wizard.</i> 13. <i>The private enticer to Idolatry.</i> 14. <i>The
publique withdrawer to Idolatry.</i> 15. <i>The Witch.</i> 16.
<i>The prophaner of the Sabbath.</i> 17. <i>He that curseth his
Father or his Mother.</i> 18. <i>The Rebellious Son.</i> The
<i>manner of stoning</i> was thus: The offender was led
to a place without the gates, two cubits high, his
hands being bound: from hence one of the Witnesses
tumbled him by a stroke upon the loins; if that
killed him not, the Witnesses lifted up a stone, being
the weight of two men, which chiefly the other Witnesse
cast upon him; if that killed him not, <i>all Israel
threw stones upon him</i>. <i>The hands of the Witnesses shall
be first upon him to put him to death, and afterwards the
hands of all the people</i>, <i>Deut. 17. 7.</i></p>

<p>Hence the opinion of <i>R. Akiba</i><a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> is commonly received,
that such an Idolater (it holdeth in all others
condemned to this death) was reserved until one of
the common feasts, at which <i>all the multitude of Israel
came to Jerusalem</i>. The party thus executed being
quite dead, was afterward for greater ignominy

time he and the tree were both buried.</p>

<p>The <i>manner of burning</i> was <i>two fold</i>. Some they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
burnt with wood and faggots; this was termed<a name="FNanchor_573" id="FNanchor_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> by
them <i>Combustio corporis</i>, <i>the burning of the body</i>: Others
they burnt by pouring in scalding hot lead in
at their mouths, which descending into their bowels
killed them, the bulk of their body remaining whole,
and this was termed therefore <i>Combustio animæ</i>, <i>the
burning of their soul</i>. This last was most in use, and alone
described by most of their Writers.</p>

4. <i>A false Prophet, and he that prophesieth in the

<p>The manner of <i>strangling</i> was thus. The malefactor
was put in dung up to the loins, a towel being cast about
his neck; which two Executioners, one on each
side, plucked to and fro until he was dead.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_VIII">CHAP. VIII.<br />
<span class="smaller"><i>Punishments not capital.</i></span></h3>

<p>The <i>lesser punishments, not capital</i>, in use among
the <i>Hebrews</i>, are chiefly four. 1. <i>Imprisonment</i>,
2. <i>Restitution</i>, 3. <i>Talio</i>, 4. <i>Scourging</i>.</p>

<p><i>Imprisonment.</i> Under this are comprehended the
<i>Prison, Stocks, Pillory, Chains, Fetters, and the like</i>:
all which sorts of punishment, seeing they differ very
little or nothing at all from those which are now in
common use with us, they need no explication.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>The <i>keepers of the Prison</i>, if they let any committed
unto them escape, were liable to the same punishment
which should have been inflicted on the party
escaped. This is gatherable from that, <i>1 Kings 20. 39.</i>
<i>Keep this man, if by any means he be missing, then shall
thy life be for his life</i>.</p>

<p>Concerning that <i>Liberia Custodia</i>, which <i>Drusius</i><a name="FNanchor_576" id="FNanchor_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a>
proveth to have been in use among the <i>Romans</i>, I
much doubt whether any such custome were in use
among the <i>Hebrews</i>. That some kind of prisoners at
<i>Rome</i> did go abroad with a lesser kind of fetters in
the day time to their work, and so return at night to
their prison, hath elsewhere been observed by me.
And<a name="FNanchor_577" id="FNanchor_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> <i>Eadem catena &amp; custodiam &amp; militem copulabat</i>,
<i>The same chain tyed both the prisoner and the
keeper</i>. Observe the unusual significations of these
two words, <i>Custodia</i> a prisoner, and <i>Miles</i> a keeper.
So that <i>Drusius</i> delivered <i>Seneca</i> his meaning, but not
his words, when he repeats them thus: <i>Eadem catena
tam reum quam militem tenet</i>. Observe further,
that the prisoner was tyed by his <i>right arm</i>, and the
<i>keeper</i> by the <i>left</i>, because the right arm is the stronger,
and therefore justly remaineth free rather to the
<i>keeper</i>, than to the <i>prisoners</i>. Hence is that,<a name="FNanchor_578" id="FNanchor_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> <i>Tu forte
leviorem in sinistra putas catenam</i>; because the <i>keeper</i>
tyed himself unto the same chain, not in way of punishment,
but voluntarily for the safer keeping of the <i>prisoner</i>.</p>

in this kind, that if they had built an house with
a beam or piece of Timber unjustly gotten, they
would pull down the house, and restore the <i>same

<p>In case of bodily maims therefore, the <i>Hebrew

labour. Thirdly, for his pain or grief arising from the
wound. Fourthly, for the <i>charge</i> in curing it. Fifthly,
for the <i>blemish</i> or deformity thereby occasioned.

<i>Talio</i> in their Law, but they also gave liberty to the

<i>Deut. 25. 2, 3.</i> where the number of stripes was
limited, which the <i>Judge</i> might not exceed. <i>Forty

that is, they began their <i>Sabbath</i> about an hour
sooner, and ended about an hour later than the law
required: where the Lord forbade them to <i>eat or

it were offered to Idols or no. The Lord commanded
them in the time of the <i>Passover</i> to <i>put away
leaven out of their Houses</i>, they would not take the
<i>name into their mouths</i><a name="FNanchor_587" id="FNanchor_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> all the time of that Feast.
The Lord commanded them to abstain from <i>eating

<i>Dabar Acher</i>, <i>Another thing</i>. In like manner the Lord
commanded chief Malefactors which deserved beating,
to be punisht with <i>forty stripes</i>; they in their
greatest corrections would give but <i>thirty nine</i>. <i>Of
the</i> Jews <i>five times received I forty stripes save one</i>,
<i>2 Cor. 11. 24.</i> For this purpose the <i>scourge</i> consisted of
<i>three thongs</i>, so that at each blow he received <i>three
stripes</i>; and in their greatest corrections were given
<i>thirteen blows</i>, that is, <i>forty stripes save one</i>. Whether
these thongs were made<a name="FNanchor_589" id="FNanchor_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> the one of a Bulls hide,

<span class="smaller"><i>Punishments borrowed from other Nations.</i></span></h3>

<p>The punishments borrowed from other Nations
are principally six: 1. <i>Crux</i>, <i>The death on
the Cross</i>. 2. <i>Serrâ dissectio</i>, <i>the cutting one asunder
with a saw</i>. 3. <i>Damnatio ad bestias</i>, <i>The committing
one to fight for his life with wild beasts</i>. 4. τροχὸς, <i>the
wheel</i>. 5. καταποντισμὸς, <i>Drowning one in the sea</i>.
6. τυμπανισμὸς, <i>Beating one to death with cudgels</i>. The
first and the third were meerly <i>Roman punishments</i>;
the second was likewise used by the <i>Romans</i>, but whether
originally taken from them is doubtful: the
fourth and the last were meerly <i>Greek punishments</i>;
the fifth was for the substance in use among <i>Hebrews</i>,
<i>Greeks</i> and <i>Romans</i>, but in the manner of drowning
them, they differed. It will be needful to speak
somewhat of all these.</p>

<p>1. <i>Crux.</i> This word is sometimes applied to <i>any
tree or stake on which a man is tortured to death</i>, but
most properly it is applied to a <i>frame of wood consisting
of two pieces of timber compacted cross-wise</i>. The
first is termed <i>Crux simplex</i>, the last <i>Crux compacta</i>.
This latter is threefold. 1. <i>Decussata.</i> 2. <i>Commissa.</i>
3. <i>Immissa.</i></p>

<p><i>Crux decussata.</i> This was made of two equal pieces
of timber obliquely crossing one the other in the
middle, after the manner of the <i>Roman</i> X, and thence it
is called <i>decussata</i>.<a name="FNanchor_595" id="FNanchor_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> <i>Decussare, est per medium secare.
Veluti si duæ regulæ concurrant ad speciem literæ</i> X,
<i>quæ figura est crucis.</i> This kind of cross is by the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
people termed <i>Crux Andræana</i>, Saint <i>Andrews-cross</i>,
because on such an one he is reported to have
been crucified.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_595" id="Footnote_595"></a><a href="#FNanchor_595"><span class="label">[595]</span></a> <i>Hieron. in
Jerem. c. 31.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Crux commissa.</i> This was, when a piece of timber
erected, was joyned in the middle to a traverse, of
over-thwart top; somewhat shorter than the piece
erect, in manner of a <i>Roman</i> T. This is called <i>Crux
Antoniana</i>, S. <i>Anthony his Cross</i>, because he is often
painted with such a <i>Cross</i>.</p>

<p><i>Crux immissa.</i> This was when a short traverse somewhat
obliquely crossed the stake erect, not quite
in the middle, as <i>Crux decussata</i>, nor quite on the top
as <i>Crux commissa</i>, but near the top, in this manner †.
This is thought<a name="FNanchor_596" id="FNanchor_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> to have been <i>Crux Christi</i>,
<i>the Cross on which our Saviour Christ suffered</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>The <i>Ceremonies</i> used by the <i>Romans</i> towards those
whom they crucified were these: First, they <i>scourged</i>
them, and sometimes tyed them to a <i>Piller</i> in
time of scourging. <i>Artemidorus</i><a name="FNanchor_597" id="FNanchor_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> is clear in this,
Προσδεθεὶς κίονι, πολλὰς ἔλαβε πληγὰς, that is, being tyed
to the <i>Piller</i>, he received many stripes. <i>Plautus<a name="FNanchor_598" id="FNanchor_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a>
is thought to have alluded</i> to the same.</p>

whipt thus <i>ad columnam</i>: but the Scripture is silent,
both touching the place and manner of this whipping,
only that he was whipt is testified. <i>He scourged
Jesus</i>, and delivered him to be crucified, <i>Mat. 27. 26.</i></p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, They caused them to <i>bear their own Cross</i>,<a name="FNanchor_600" id="FNanchor_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a>
<i>Malefici cùm ad supplicium educuntur, quisq; suum effert

<p><i>Thirdly</i>,<a name="FNanchor_601" id="FNanchor_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> That the equity of the proceeding might
clearly appear, the cause of the punishment was
written in a table, and so carried before the condemned
person; or else it was proclamed by a publick
Cryer. This cause was termed by the <i>Romans</i> commonly
<i>Titulus</i>, by some<a name="FNanchor_602" id="FNanchor_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> it is called <i>Elegium</i>. Thus
Pilate <i>wrote in Hebrew, Greek, and Latine, Jesus of Nazareth,
the King of the Jews</i>.</p>

them from the head downward. The <i>Romans</i><a name="FNanchor_604" id="FNanchor_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a>
they used this kind of punishment, so likewise did the
<i>Hebrews</i>. Thus <i>Manasses</i> is thought to have punisht
the <i>Prophet Isaiah</i>, and the Apostle to have alluded
unto it, <i>They were sawn a-sunder</i>, <i>Heb. 11. 37.</i></p>

<p><i>Damnatio ad bestias.</i> Those who were condemned
to wild beasts, are properly termed <i>Bestiarii</i>. Whether
S. <i>Paul</i> did, according to the letter, fight with
beasts at <i>Ephesus</i>, <i>1 Cor. 15. 32.</i> is much controversed.
Some<a name="FNanchor_605" id="FNanchor_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> understand by <i>Beasts</i>, <i>Demetrius</i>, and others
that opposed him at <i>Ephesus</i>, others<a name="FNanchor_606" id="FNanchor_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> more probably
understand the word <i>literally</i>. And this kind
of punishment was commonly exercised against
<i>Christians</i> in the <i>Primitive Church</i>, insomuch that the
<i>Heathens</i> imputing the cause of all publick calamities
unto the <i>Christians</i>, would call out,<a name="FNanchor_607" id="FNanchor_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a> <i>Christianos
ad Leones!</i> <i>Let the Christians be haled to Lyons</i>: yea,
the litteral interpretation of the words, is a stronger
argument that Saint <i>Paul</i> believed the Resurrection
(which is the scope of the text) than to understand
the words of a metaphorical fight, against the enemies
of his doctrine.</p>

no more but this, that <i>as the wheel turneth round,
so by the wisdom of a King the mischief intended by
wicked men, is brought upon their own head</i>. That hereby

make mention of any such punishment in use among
the <i>Jews</i>. Among the <i>Greeks</i> there was a punishment
went under this name:<a name="FNanchor_608" id="FNanchor_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> it was called τροχὸς, A

a confession.</p>

judged any to this kind of punishment, they wrapt

<p>Τυμπανισμὸς. It is rendred by the general name of

a special kind of torturing, by beating one with
cudgels unto death. It hath its denomination from
τύμπανον, which signifieth a <i>Drum</i> usually: and hence
some<a name="FNanchor_612" id="FNanchor_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a> have parallel’d this torture with that

with cudgels</i>, as if it were with <i>drum-sticks</i>. This is
evident by <i>Eleazar</i>; he came willingly, ἐπὶ τὸ τύμπανον,
<i>to this kind of torment</i>, <i>2 Macab. 6. 19.</i> and in the thirtieth
verse, where he gave up the Ghost, there is mention
of his strokes, not of his <i>racking or stretching</i>.</p>

<p><i>Junius</i><a name="FNanchor_614" id="FNanchor_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> reckoneth another kind of punishment
termed by the <i>Hebrews</i>, ‎‏צינק‏‎ <i>Tsinok</i>, which he would
have to be a compound word: doubtless his meaning
is that it would be compounded of ‎‏צי‏‎ <i>Tsi</i>, <i>Navis</i>, <i>a
ship, or boat</i>, and ‎‏ינק‏‎ <i>Janack</i>, <i>Sugere</i>, <i>to suck</i>: for he saith
that thereby is meant a certain punishment, termed
<i>Navicula sugentis</i> which <i>Plutarch</i><a name="FNanchor_615" id="FNanchor_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> describeth in
this manner; <i>That the offender should be inclosed between

in vagina</i>) <i>as in a sheath; and, to preserve life in him,
milk and honey tempered together was forcibly put into

this <i>sucking in of milk and honey</i>, this punishment hath
been termed <i>Navicula sugentis</i>. But the <i>Hebrews</i><a name="FNanchor_616" id="FNanchor_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a>
say, that <i>Tsinock</i> was nothing else but <i>manacles</i>, or
<i>cords</i>, wherewith prisoners hands were tyed. I leave
it indifferent to the Reader to follow which interpretation
he please.</p>

<p>Their <i>Sacraments</i> were two. First, the <i>Passover</i>
of which there hath been a set Chapter. Secondly,
<i>Circumcision</i>, of which now.</p>

<p><i>Circumcision</i>, was a cutting off the foreskin, as a
sign and seal of <i>Gods</i> Covenant made with the People
of the <i>Jews</i>. It is called a <i>sign</i> by <i>God</i> in its first
institution, <i>Gen. 17.</i> and a <i>seal</i> by the <i>Apostle</i>, <i>Rom.
4. 11.</i> Yea, it is called a <i>sign</i> and a seal, by a <i>Doctor</i>
of the <i>Jews</i>,<a name="FNanchor_617" id="FNanchor_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> more ancient than their <i>Talmud</i>.</p>

<p>It was used (though not as a <i>Sacrament</i>) by many
other Nations:<a name="FNanchor_618" id="FNanchor_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> by the inhabitants of <i>Colchis</i>, the

<p>In a figurative sense, alluding unto this <i>Sacramental
Rite</i>, we read of three other sorts of <i>Circumcision</i>
in the <i>Scripture</i>; so that in all there are four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
mentioned. 1. <i>This of the flesh.</i> 2. <i>Another of the heart.</i> 3. <i>A
third of the lips.</i> 4. And a <i>fourth of the ears</i>. We are
to consider it in its proper acception, and here to observe:
First, the <i>time when</i> it was administred. Secondly,
the <i>manner how</i>. Thirdly, the <i>penalty in case
it was omitted</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>time</i> was the <i>eighth day</i>; yea, the <i>eighth day</i>
was so precisely observed, that if it fell on the <i>Sabbath</i>,
yet they <i>circumcised the <span class="antiqua">Child</span></i>; whence rose
that saying among them, <i>Circumcisio pellit Sabbatum</i>
<i>Circumcision driveth away the Sabbath</i>; or, the <i>Sabbath</i>
giveth place to <i>Circumcision</i>. And with this accordeth
that of our Saviour, <i>Ye on the Sabbath day circumcise
a man</i>, <i>John 7. 22.</i> The <i>Jews</i> superstitiously conceiting
that each creatures perfection depended upon
the sanctification of one <i>Sabbath</i> day at least, say that
<i>God</i> did therefore enjoyn the <i>eighth day</i>, that one
<i>Sabbath</i> might first pass over each male, before he
should be partaker of this Sacrament. But more probably
we may say, that the reasons why God would
not suffer them to anticipate the <i>eighth day</i>, were first
to shew, that <i>God</i> in the matter of Salvation, neither
was, nor is <i>simply tyed to Sacraments</i>; for then there
had been no less cruelty in <i>forbidding Circumcision
until the eighth day</i>, than there was love in <i>permitting
it upon the eighth</i>. Secondly, because in this time of
the <i>Mosaical Pedagogie</i>, there was a kind of <i>legal uncleanness</i>,
in which the creatures were thought to be,
as remaining in their blood, for the first <i>seven daies</i>
after their birth, <i>Levit. 22. 27.</i> <i>It. 12. 2, 3.</i> Notwithstanding,
<i>God</i> thought it not convenient to defer it
longer than eight daies, for the comfort of the Parents,
which they received by a mature and seasonable
initiation of their children.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>The manner how Circumcision was administred, I
find thus recorded: Some of those that were present
held a vessel full of dust,<a name="FNanchor_619" id="FNanchor_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> into which they did
cast the foreskin being cut off. Again, they prepared
in the room, a certain <i>void chair for Elias</i>;<a name="FNanchor_620" id="FNanchor_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a>
which was done, partly in honour of him, for which
respect also, as often as they fell on any difficult place
in Scripture they would say<a name="FNanchor_621" id="FNanchor_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> <i>Veniet Elias, &amp; omnia
enodabit</i>; <i>We know that Elias will come, and he will
tell us all things</i>: But chiefly it was done, because
they thought <i>Elias</i> to be present there in spirit, whose
bodily coming they did, and do daily expect.
These ceremonies are meerly <i>Jewish</i>, practised by
the latter <i>Jews</i>, but utterly unknown in our <i>Saviour
Christ</i> his time, and, as it appeareth by the <i>Samaritan
woman</i> her speech, that proverbial saying applyed
now to <i>Elias</i>, was of old applyed to <i>Christ</i>, <i>John
4. 25.</i> <i>Thirdly</i>, he which supplyed the place of the
<i>Witness</i>, or as we phrase it, of the <i>Godfather</i>,<a name="FNanchor_622" id="FNanchor_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> held
the Child in his arms whiles it was <i>Circumcised</i>:
this <i>Godfather</i> they called <i>Baal Berith</i>, and <i>Sandack</i>;
that is, the <i>Master of the Covenant</i>. Uriah <i>the Priest</i>,
and <i>Zachariah</i> the son of <i>Jeberechia</i>, are thought<a name="FNanchor_623" id="FNanchor_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a>
to have been <i>Godfathers</i> at the Circumcision of <i>Maher-shalal-hash-baz</i>,
<i>Esay. 8. 2.</i> and from them the custome
of having <i>Godfathers</i> in <i>Baptisme</i>, to have taken
its original. <i>Fourthly</i>, the Parents named the Child,
and in <i>Zacharies</i> time, it seemeth that in the naming
of the Infant, they had respect to some name
of his Ancestors. <i>They said unto her, there is none of thy
kindred that is named with this name</i>, <i>Luk. 1. 61.</i> Other
Nations had their set daies also after the birth, for
the naming of their Children. The <i>Romans</i><a name="FNanchor_624" id="FNanchor_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> gave
names to their male-children on the ninth day, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
female on the eighth. The <i>Athenians</i><a name="FNanchor_625" id="FNanchor_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> gave names
on the tenth. Others<a name="FNanchor_626" id="FNanchor_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> on the seventh. These
daies <i>Tertullian</i><a name="FNanchor_627" id="FNanchor_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> called <i>Nominalia</i>. The <i>Grecians</i> besides
the tenth day on which they named the Child,
they observed also the <i>fifth</i>,<a name="FNanchor_628" id="FNanchor_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> on which day the
Midwives took the Child, and ran about a fire made
for that purpose, using that Ceremony as a purification
of themselves and the Child: on this day the
Neighbours also sent in <i>gifts</i>, or <i>small tokens</i>, <i>Munera
natalitia</i>;<a name="FNanchor_629" id="FNanchor_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> from which custom that amongst <i>Christians</i>,
of the <i>Godfathers</i> sending gifts to the baptized
Infant, is thought to have flown. But to return again
to the Rites of the <i>Jews</i>. After the Child had been
<i>circumcised</i>, the Father said:<a name="FNanchor_630" id="FNanchor_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> <i>Blessed be our Lord
God, who hath sanctified us with his precepts, and hath
commanded us, that we should cause this child to enter
into the Covenant of Abraham</i>. After this, the whole
Church or company present replyed in this manner,<a name="FNanchor_631" id="FNanchor_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a>
<i>As thou hast made him to enter into the Covenant,
so make him also to enter into the Law, into Matrimony,
and into good works</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>penalty</i> for the omission of <i>Circumcision</i> running
in this form; <i>That soul shall be cut off from his
people</i>, <i>Gen. 17. 14.</i> I understand the <i>penalty</i> to be pronounced
against such an omission; which proceeded
either from <i>contempt</i> or <i>wilful neglect</i>. In this
case the question is, what is meant by this phrase,
<i>His soul shall be cut off from the people</i>. Secondly, <i>who
ought thus to be punisht?</i> whether the child, or the <i>parents</i>,
and such who <i>supply the place of parents</i>? For
the first, besides <i>Gods</i> secret action in punishing such
Delinquents, methinks there is a rule of direction
for the Church, how to proceed against such in her
Discipline: If any understand here, by <i>cutting off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
such a mans soul from his people</i>, the sentence of <i>excommunication</i>,
or <i>casting him out of the Synagogue</i>, I shall
not oppose it; though I rather incline to those, who
understand hereby a <i>bodily death</i> inflicted upon such
an offender, in which sense the phrase is taken, <i>Exod.
31. 14.</i> <i>Whosoever doth any work on the Sabbath, that
soul shall be cut off from among his people</i>. And it is very
remarkable, that when <i>Moses</i> his child was <i>uncircumcised,
the Lord sought to kill Moses</i>: which as it intimated
the punishment of this fault to be a <i>bodily
death</i> so it clearly evinceth, that not the <i>child</i> till he
cometh to years of discretion, but the <i>parents</i> were liable
to punishment. The opinion of the <i>Rabbines</i> concerning
this latter point is thus delivered:<a name="FNanchor_632" id="FNanchor_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> <i>If the
Father circumcise him not, then the Judges are commanded
to circumcise him: and if it be unknown to the
Judges, and they circumcise him not, when he is waxen
great, he is bound to circumcise himself, and every day
that passeth over him, after he is waxen great, and, he circumciseth
not himself, lo he breaketh the Commandment.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Here it may be demanded, how it is possible for a
man, after once he hath been marked with the sign
of <i>Circumcision</i>, to blot out that character and become
<i>uncircumcised</i>? for thus some <i>Jews</i>, for fear of
<i>Antiochus</i>, made themselves uncircumcised, <i>1 Mac. 1.
16.</i> Others for shame, after they were gained to the
knowledge of Christ, and to entertainment of
the <i>Christian faith, uncircumcised themselves</i>, <i>1 Cor. 7.
18.</i> The answer is,<a name="FNanchor_633" id="FNanchor_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> that this was done by <i>drawing
up the foreskin</i> with a Chirurgion his instrument; and
unto this the <i>Apostle</i> in the fore quoted place alludeth,
μὴ ἐπισπάσθω, <i>Ne attrahat præputium</i>. This wicked
invention is ascribed unto <i>Esau</i>, as the first <i>Author</i>
and practiser thereof.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of their first fruits and their firstlings, or first-born.</i></span></h3>

<p>The use and end of their <i>first-fruits</i>, was that
the <i>after-fruits</i> might be <i>consecrated in them</i>.
To this purpose they were enjoyned to offer the
<i>first fruits of their trees</i>, which served for food, <i>Levit.
19. 23, 24.</i> In which this order was observed; the
<i>three first years</i> after the tree had been planted, the
fruits were counted <i>uncircumcised</i> and <i>unclean</i>: it
was unlawful to <i>eat them, sell them, or make any benefit
of them</i>: on the <i>fourth year</i>, they were accounted
<i>holy</i>, that is, either they were given to the <i>Priests</i>,<a name="FNanchor_634" id="FNanchor_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a>
<i>Num. 18. 12, 13.</i> or the owners did eat them before
the <i>Lord at Jerusalem</i>, as they did their <i>second tithe</i>:
and this <i>latter</i> is the common opinion of the <i>Hebrews</i>.<a name="FNanchor_635" id="FNanchor_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a>
After the <i>fourth year</i>, they returned to the use
of the owner: we may call these πρωτογεννήματα, <i>simply
the first-fruits</i>.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, they were enjoyned to pay yearly the
<i>first-fruits of every years increase</i>, and these we may
call, ἀπαρχὰς, and of them there were many sorts.
<i>First, first-fruits in the sheaf</i>, <i>Lev. 23. 10.</i> <i>Secondly, first-fruits
in two wave-loaves</i>, <i>Levit. 23. 17.</i> These two
bounded their harvest, <i>that in the sheaf</i> was offered
in the <i>beginning of harvest</i>, upon the fifteenth of <i>Nisan</i>,
<i>the other of the loavs at the end</i>, upon their <i>Penticost</i>:
and <i>Levit. 23.</i> they are both called ‎‏תנופות‏‎ <i>Thenuphoth</i>,
that is, <i>shake-offerings</i>. <i>Thirdly</i>, there was a
<i>first of the dough</i>. <i>Num. 15. 20.</i> namely,<a name="FNanchor_636" id="FNanchor_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> a <i>four and
twentieth part thereof</i>, given unto the <i>Priests</i>: which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
kind of offering was observed, even when they were
returned out of <i>Babylon</i>, <i>Nehem. 10. 37.</i> Unto this St.
<i>Paul</i> hath reference, <i>Rom. 11. 16.</i> <i>If the first fruits be
holy, the lump is holy</i>. <i>Fourthly</i>, they were to pay
unto the <i>Priests</i> the <i>first-fruits of the threshing floor</i>,
<i>Numb. 15. 20.</i> These two last are called ‎‏תרומות‏‎ <i>Therumoth</i>,
that is, <i>heave offerings</i>: this the <i>heave-offering
of the threshing floor</i>; the other the <i>heave-offering
of the dough</i>, <i>Numb. 15. 20.</i> Under the name of <i>first-fruits</i>,
commonly Authors treat of no others but this
last, and wholly omit all the former sorts. Before
we proceed to the explaining of the last, note with
me the difference of these two words, <i>Thenuphoth</i>,
and <i>Therumoth</i>: both signifie <i>shake-offerings</i>, <i>heave-offerings</i>,
or <i>wave offerings</i>, but with this difference;<a name="FNanchor_637" id="FNanchor_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a>
the <i>Therumoth</i> was by a <i>waving of elevation</i>, lifting
the oblation upward and downward, to signifie,
that <i>God</i> was <i>Lord</i> both of Heaven and Earth. The
<i>Thenuphoth</i> was by a waving of <i>agitation</i>, waving it
to and fro, from the right hand to the left, from the
<i>East</i> to the <i>West</i>, from the <i>North</i> to the <i>South</i>: by
which kind of <i>agitation</i>, they acknowledged <i>God</i> to
be <i>Lord</i> of the whole world. Now, that we may
know what these <i>first-fruits of the threshing floor were</i>,
the <i>Rabbies</i>, and the others following them, distinguish
them into <i>two sorts</i>: the first of these, was <i>first-fruits</i>
of seven things only: 1 <i>Wheat.</i> 2 <i>Barley.</i> 3 <i>Grapes.</i>
4 <i>Figs.</i> 5 <i>Pomgranates.</i> 6 <i>Olives.</i> 7 <i>Dates.</i> For all
which the Promised Land is commended, <i>Deut. 8. 8.</i>
These the <i>Talmudists</i><a name="FNanchor_638" id="FNanchor_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> term ‎‏בכורים‏‎ <i>Biccurim</i>; and
when they treat of <i>first-fruites</i> they treat of them under
this name, and understand by the name of <i>Biccurim</i>
no other. These, they say, are the <i>first fruits</i>,
which the people are so often in the Law commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
to bring up unto the <i>Sanctuary</i>, at the <i>Feast of
Pentecost</i>, which was the end and closure of their harvest,
as was signified both by this oblation, and likewise
by that of the two <i>wave-loaves</i>, <i>Lev. 23. 17.</i></p>

obnoxium est primitiis, Therumæ, &amp; decimis</i>. This they
call, ‎‏תרומה‏‎ <i>Theruma</i>, an <i>heave-offering</i>: the <i>Greek</i> renders
it, ἀφωρίσμος, <i>A separation</i>, because this was a
<i>consecration, or setting apart of the Lords portion</i>. In allusion
unto this, I take S. <i>Paul</i> to have termed himself
ἀφωρισμένον ἐς ἐυαγγέλιον, <i>separated unto the Gospel</i>, <i>Rom.
1. 1.</i> ἀφοριεῖ Ἀαρὼν, <i>Aaron shall separate the Levites</i>, so the
<i>Greek</i> renders it; but the Original is, <i>Aaron shall wave
the Levites</i>, <i>Numb. 8. 11.</i> Again, ἀφορίσατε <i>Separate me
Barnabas and Saul</i>, <i>Acts 13. 2.</i> <i>Drusius</i> delivereth another
reason, as hath been said in the <i>Chapter</i> of the
<i>Pharisees</i>. But to proceed: the <i>Hebrews</i> called this second
payment, not only <i>Theruma</i>, <i>simple</i>, but sometimes
<i>Theruma gedola</i>,<a name="FNanchor_640" id="FNanchor_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> the <i>great heave offering</i>, in
comparison of that <i>Tithe</i> which the <i>Levites</i> payed
unto the <i>Priests</i>: for that was termed <i>Theruma magnasher</i>,
the <i>heave offering of the Tithe</i>, <i>Numb. 18. 26.</i>
which though it were <i>one of ten</i>, in respect of that portion
which the <i>Levites</i> received; yet it was but <i>one
of an hundered</i>, in respect of the Husbandmans stock,
who payed the <i>Levites</i>: and thus it was a great deal
less than the <i>great heave offering</i>, as will presently appear.
This (the <i>Hebrews</i> say) the owners were not
bound to bring up to <i>Jerusalem</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>law</i> prescribed no set quantity to be paid, either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
in the <i>Biccurim</i> or in the <i>Theruma</i>; but, by <i>tradition</i>,
they were taught to pay at least the <i>sixtieth</i> part
in both, even in those <i>seven things</i>, also paid under
the name of <i>Biccurim</i>, or <i>first fruits</i>, as well as in their
<i>heave-offering</i> termed <i>Theruma</i>, or <i>Theruma gedola</i>.</p>

<p>Thus the <i>Talmudists</i> do distinguish the <i>Biccurim</i>
from the <i>Theruma gedola</i>: but in my opinion the <i>Biccurim</i>
may be contained under <i>Theruma gedola</i>; and
in truth, both of them are nothing else but the <i>heave-offering
of the floor</i>, formerly mentioned out of <i>Num.
15. 20.</i> My reasons are these: 1. <i>Scripture</i> giveth no
such leave to keep any part of their <i>first-fruits</i> at
home; if that could be proved, the distinction were
warrantable. 2. <i>Scripture</i> doth not limit <i>first fruits</i>
unto those <i>seven kinds</i>, which alone go under the
name of <i>Biccurim</i>. 3. Themselves confound both
members; for their <i>Biccurim</i>, they say, they paid,
1. <i>Wheat.</i> 2. <i>Barley.</i> In their <i>Theruma</i>, they say, they
paid <i>Corn</i>; as if under <i>Corn</i>; <i>Wheat</i> and <i>Barley</i> were
not contained. Some may say, they paid their <i>Biccurim
in the Ear</i>, while the harvest was yet standing
and their <i>Theruma in Wheat and Barley ready threshed
and winnowed</i>. My reasons why it cannot be so, are
these: 1. Because then they should pay <i>twice a sixtieth
part</i> in their corn. 2. Because the corn offered in
the sheaf was but a little quantity, and it was offered
not at their <i>Pentecost</i> when their harvest ended, but
at their <i>Passover</i> when their harvest began, <i>Levit. 23.
10.</i> Whereas their <i>Biccurim</i>, or <i>first fruits</i>, were alwayes
offered at their <i>Pentecost</i>.</p>

<p>But omitting further proofs, I proceed to shew
the ground, why in this <i>heave-offering of the floor</i>, at
least a <i>sixtieth part</i> was prescribed: it is grounded
upon that of the Prophet <i>Ezek.</i> This is the oblation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
that ye shall offer, <i>the sixth part of an Ephah out of an
Homer</i>, <i>Ezek. 45. 13.</i> that is, <i>the sixtieth part of the
whole</i>, because an <i>Homer</i> containeth ten <i>Ephahs</i>. Hence
they took that distinction of these offerings. Some<a name="FNanchor_641" id="FNanchor_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a>
they say, gave the <i>fortieth part of their encrease</i>: this,
because it was the greatest quantity given in this kind
of oblations, they termed <i>Theruma oculi boni</i>,<a name="FNanchor_642" id="FNanchor_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a>
<i>The oblation of a fair eye</i>: others (though they were
not so liberal as the former, yet they might not
be reputed niggardly) gave a <i>fiftieth part</i>, and this
they termed <i>Theruma mediana</i>,<a name="FNanchor_643" id="FNanchor_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> <i>The oblation of a
middle eye</i>: others, whom they reputed sordid, gave
just a <i>sixtieth part</i>, less then which they could not
give, this they termed <i>Theruma oculi mali</i>,<a name="FNanchor_644" id="FNanchor_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> <i>The oblation
of an evill eye</i>; so that the payment of these was
bounded by the tradition of the <i>Elders</i>, between the
<i>sixtieth</i> and the <i>fortieth part</i>: But the <i>Pharisees</i><a name="FNanchor_645" id="FNanchor_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> that
they might be <i>holy above others</i>, made their bounds the
<i>fiftieth</i> and the <i>thirtieth part</i>; so that he was reputed
<i>sordid</i> with them that paid the <i>fiftieth part</i>; and none
liberal except he paid the <i>thirtieth</i>. The manner how
these first-fruites termed <i>Biccurim</i> were paid, is at
large set down, <i>Deut. 26.</i> But in time of the <i>Prophets</i>
other <i>Ceremonies</i> seem to have been received, of
which the <i>Hebrew Docters</i> say thus:<a name="FNanchor_646" id="FNanchor_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> <i>When they
carried up their first-fruits, all the Cities that were in a
county gathered together to the chief City of the county
to the end that they might not go up alone: for it is said,
In the multitude of people is the Kings honour</i>, <i>Prov. 14.
28.</i> <i>And they came and lodged all night in the streets of
the City, and went not into houses, for fear of pollution:
and in the morning the Governor said, Arise, and let us go
up to Sion, the City of the Lord our God. And before them
went a Bull which had his horns covered with Gold, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
an Olive Garland on his head, to signifie the first fruits of
the seven kinds of fruits. There was likewise a pipe struck
up before them, untill they came near to Jerusalem and
all the way as they went, they sung, I rejoyced in them
that said unto me, we will go into the house of the Lord</i>,
&amp;c. <i>Psal. 122.</i> Unto this, and other like manner of solemn
Assemblies the <i>Prophet</i> hath reference, saying,
<i>Ye shall have a song as in a night when a holy solemnity
is kept, and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a
pipe to come unto the mountain of the Lord</i>, <i>Esay. 30. 29.</i></p>

<p>The <i>firstlings</i>, or <i>first-born</i> of man and beast, the
<i>Lord</i> challenged as his own, <i>Exod. 13.</i> The ground of
this Law was, because <i>God smote all the first-born in
Egypt from man to beast, but spared the Israelites</i>; for
a perpetual memory of which benefit, he commanded
them to sanctifie all their <i>first-born males</i> unto
him. Now the <i>first born men, and unclean beasts</i>, were
redeemed for five silver shekels of the <i>sanctuary</i>, paid
unto the <i>Priests</i> for each of them, <i>Numb. 18. 15, 16.</i>
Unto this S. <i>Peter</i> alludeth saying, <i>We are not redeemed
with corruptible things, as silver and gold</i>, <i>1 Pet. 1.
18.</i> The <i>firstlings of a clean beasts</i> ought to be sacrificed,
their blood to be sprinkled on the Altar, their fat to
be burnt for a burnt-offering, and their flesh to return
to the <i>Priests</i>.</p>

<p>Observe how <i>God</i> would be honoured by the <i>firstlings
of men and cattel</i>; by the <i>first-fruits of trees, and
of the earth, in the sheaf, in the threshing-floor, in the
dough, in the loavs</i>: All which teach us <i>to consecrate
the first and prime of our years unto the Lord</i>.</p>

<p>We are here to enquire: First, <i>what things</i>
in general were titheable: <i>Secondly</i> how
many <i>kind of Tithes</i> there were: Thirdly, the <i>time</i>
when each sort of <i>tithes</i> began to be <i>titheable</i>.</p>

<p>First, their yearly encrease was either <i>Cattel</i>, <i>fruits
of the trees</i>, or <i>fruits of the land</i>; of <i>all these</i><a name="FNanchor_647" id="FNanchor_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> they
payed <i>tithes</i>, even to mint, anise, and cumine, <i>These

<p>Secondly, the <i>sorts of tithes</i> payed out of the fruits,
both of the trees and the land, by the Husbandman,
were two, payd in this manner: When the Harvest
had been ended, and all gathered, then the Husbandman
laid aside his <i>great Theruma</i>, otherwise
called the <i>first-fruits of his threshing floor</i>, of which it
hath been spoken in the <i>Chapter of the first fruits</i>. This
being done, then out of the remainder he paid a <i>tenth
part</i> unto the <i>Levites</i>, and this they termed <i>Magnasher
rischon</i>,<a name="FNanchor_648" id="FNanchor_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> <i>the first tithe</i>, <i>Tob. 1. 7.</i> This was always
paid in kind, and as it seemeth to me, it was not
brought up to <i>Jerusalem</i> by the husbandman, (others<a name="FNanchor_649" id="FNanchor_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a>
think otherwise) but payed unto the <i>Levites</i>
in the several Cities of tillage, <i>Neh. 10. 37.</i> out of this
<i>first tithe</i> the <i>Levites paid a tenth portion</i> unto the
<i>Priests</i>; this they termed <i>Magnasher min hammagnasher</i>,<a name="FNanchor_650" id="FNanchor_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>
<i>the tithe of the Tithes</i>, <i>Neh. 10. 38.</i> and <i>Decima
sanctitatum</i>, the <i>tithe of holy things</i>, <i>2 Chron. 31. 6.</i> this
the <i>Levites</i> brought up to the house of <i>God</i>, <i>Neh. 10.
38.</i> When the <i>Levites</i> had paid this tenth portion
unto the <i>Priests</i>, then the <i>Levites</i> and their Families<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
might eat the remainder of the first tithe in any
place, even out of <i>Jerusalem</i>, <i>Num. 18. 31.</i></p>

<p>This first tithe being paid, the Husbandman paid
out of that which remained a second tithe; this the
Husbandman might pay in kind if he pleased, or
if he would, he might by way of commutation pay
the worth thereof in money; but when he payed in
money, he added a fifth part; so that what in kind
was <i>ten in the hundred</i>, that changed into money, was
<i>twelve in the hundred</i>. This the Husbandman brought
up unto <i>Jerusalem</i>, and made a kind of Love-feast
therewith, unto which he invited the <i>Priests</i> and <i>Levites</i>,
only every <i>third year</i> he carried it not to <i>Jerusalem</i>,
<i>but spent it at home within his own gates</i>, upon
the <i>Levites, the fatherless, the widows, &amp; the poor</i>, <i>Deut.
14. 28.</i> They reckoned<a name="FNanchor_651" id="FNanchor_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> their third year from the
<i>Sabbatical year</i>, on which the land rested: so that
the first and second <i>Tithe</i> was payed by the Husbandman;
the <i>first, second, fourth and fifth years after the
Sabbatical year</i>: but upon the third and sixth years
only, the first <i>Tithe</i> was paid to the <i>Levites</i>, and
the second was spent at home. Hence in respect of
the <i>kinds</i>, this is called <i>Magnasher scheni</i>,<a name="FNanchor_652" id="FNanchor_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> the second
<i>tithe</i>, <i>Tobit. 1. 7.</i> in respect it was paid to the
poor every third year: it is called <i>Magnasher
gnani</i><a name="FNanchor_653" id="FNanchor_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>, πτωχοδεκάδαι, <i>the poor mans tithe</i>, and <i>Magnasher
schelischi</i><a name="FNanchor_654" id="FNanchor_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a>, <i>the third tithe</i>, <i>Tob. 1. 1.</i> On those
years on which it was carried up to <i>Jerusalem</i>, it
ought of necessity to be eaten within the <i>Court of the
Temple</i>, <i>Deut. 14. 26.</i> and by the <i>third tithe</i> we are
to understand the <i>poor mans tithe on the third year</i>,
which year is termed <i>a year of tithes</i>, <i>Deut. 26. 12.</i></p>

<p>They likewise tithed their cattel. <i>Of their bullocks,
&amp; their sheep, and all that passed under the rod, the tenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
was holy to the Lord</i>, <i>Lev. 27. 32.</i> Some Expositors understand
by this phrase of <i>passing under the rod</i>, that
all cattel are <i>titheable</i> which live under the <i>custody of
a keeper</i>, as if there were allusion to the <i>shephards staff</i>,
or <i>keepers rod</i>, which they use in keeping their cattel.
The <i>Hebrews</i> more probably understand hereby, the
<i>manner of their decimation</i> or <i>tithing</i> their cattel,
which was as followeth.<a name="FNanchor_655" id="FNanchor_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> <i>He that hath Lambs (or
Bullocks) thus separateth his tenth, he gathereth all his
lambs and all his bullocks into a fold to which he maketh
a little door, that two cannot go forth together; their
dams are placed without the door, to the end, that the
lambs hearing them bleating, might go forth one after
another in order. Then one beginneth to number with
his rod, one, two, three, <span class="antiqua">&amp;c.</span> and the tenth which cometh
forth, whether it be male or female, perfect, or blemished,
he marketh it with a red mark, saying this is for tithe.</i>
At this day the <i>Jews</i>, though they are not in their
own Country, neither have any <i>Levitical Priesthood</i>,
yet those who will be reputed religious among
them, do distribute in lieu of tithes, the tenth of
their encrease unto the poor, being perswaded that
<i>God</i> doth bless their estates the more: for their usual
Proverb is,<a name="FNanchor_656" id="FNanchor_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> <i>Thegnasher, bischebil sche thegnasher</i>;

<p>We are to know moreover, that through the corruption
of the times, in time of <i>Hezekiah</i>’s reign,
Tithes began generally to be neglected, insomuch
that then <i>Overseers</i> were appointed to look to the
true payment thereof, <i>2 Chr. 31. 13.</i> Notwithstanding,
partly through the <i>negligence</i> of the <i>Overseers</i>, partly
through the <i>covetousness</i> of the <i>people</i>, about one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
hundred thirty years before our <i>Saviours Incarnation</i>,
corruption so prevailed, that the people in a manner
<i>neglected all tithes</i>, yea none or very few payed
either their first, second, or <i>poor manns tithe</i>, only they
paid the <i>great heave-offering</i> justly. For this reason
(saith <i>Moses Kotsensis</i><a name="FNanchor_659" id="FNanchor_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a>) <i>in the daies of</i> John <i>the
Priest, who succeeded</i> Simeon <i>the just</i>, (I take it he
meaneth <i>Johannes Hyrcanus</i>) their great Court, termed
their <i>Sanhedrim</i>, made a Decree, that more faithful
<i>Overseers</i> should be appointed for the <i>Tithes</i>. At this
time many things became questionable, whether they
were tithable or no; whence the high Court of their
<i>Sanhedrim</i> decreed, that in the <i>things doubtful</i> (which
they termed ‎‏דמאי‏‎ <i>Demai</i>)<a name="FNanchor_660" id="FNanchor_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> though they paid neither
first, nor <i>poor mans tithe</i>, yet they paid a second
<i>tithe, and a small heave-offering</i>; namely, ‎‏אחד ממאה‏‎
<i>one part of an hundred</i>: <i>Mint</i>, <i>Anise</i> and <i>Cummin</i>,
seemeth to have been of these <i>doubtful things</i>; in
which, though the decree of their <i>Sanhedrim</i> required
but <i>one in the hundred</i>, yet the <i>Pharisees</i> would pay a
just tenth, <i>Mat. 23. 23.</i>, and hence it is that they boasted,
<i>They gave tithes of all that they possessed</i>, <i>Luk. 18.
12.</i> In which they outstripped the other <i>Jews</i>, who
in these payments took the liberty granted them by
the <i>Sanhedrim</i>.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of their Marriages.</i></span></h3>

<p>In this Chapter of their <i>Marriages</i>, we are to consider:
First, the <i>distinction of their wives</i>. Secondly,
the <i>manner of their betrothings</i>. Thirdly, the <i>rites and
ceremonies of their marriage</i>. Lastly, the <i>forme of their
divorce</i>. The <i>Patriarchs</i> in the <i>Old Testament</i> had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
many of them, <i>two sorts of wives</i>: both of them were
<i>reputed lawful</i>, and <i>true wives</i>, and therefore the children
of both were accounted <i>legitimate</i>. The <i>Hebrews</i>
commonly call the one ‎‏נשים‏‎ <i>Naschim</i>; <i>Primary-wives</i>,
married with nuptial ceremonies and rites requisite.
Some derive the word from ‎‏נשה‏‎ <i>Nischa</i>,
<i>Oblitus fuit, quasi Obliviosæ dictæ</i>, because for the most
part, <i>womens memory is not so strong as mens</i>: but they
think not amiss, who say that women are so called
from <i>oblivion</i>, or <i>forgetfulness</i>, because the Fathers family
is <i>forgotten</i>, and in a manner <i>extinct in their
daughters when they are married</i>. Hence proceeds that
common saying of the <i>Hebrews</i>,<a name="FNanchor_661" id="FNanchor_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> <i>Familia matris
non vocatur familia</i>: and for the contrary reason, a
<i>male child</i> is called ‎‏זכר‏‎ <i>Zacar</i>, from his memory, <i>because
the memory of the Father is preserved in the
Son</i>,<a name="FNanchor_662" id="FNanchor_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> according to that speech of Absolom, <i>I have no
Son to keep my name in remembrance</i>, 2 Sam. 18. 18.</p>

<p>The other sort of wives they call<a name="FNanchor_663" id="FNanchor_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> <i>Pillagshin</i>,
<i>secondary wives</i>, or <i>half wives</i>; the <i>English</i> translates
them <i>Concubines</i>, and that not unfitly, for sometimes
the <i>Hebrew</i> word it self denoteth an <i>infamous Strumpet</i>,
or <i>common Harlot</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>The differences between these <i>Concubines</i>, and the
<i>chief</i> or <i>primary wives</i>, are many. 1. A <i>disparity</i> in their
authority, or houshold government: the <i>Wife</i> was a
<i>Mistress</i>, the <i>Concubine</i> as an <i>hand-maid</i> or <i>servant</i>.
She had only <i>Jus thori</i>, a true and lawful <i>right unto the
marriage bed</i> as the chief wife had; otherwise she was
in all respects inferiour. And this appeareth in the
history of <i>Sarah</i> and <i>Hagar</i>. Secondly, the <i>betrothing</i>
was different: the <i>chief wife</i> at her espousals received
from her Husband certain <i>Gifts</i> and <i>Tokens</i>, as
pledges and ceremonies of the contract. Thus <i>Abrahams</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
steward (who is probably thought to be <i>Eliezer</i>,
of whom we read, <i>Gen. 15. 2.</i>) gave in <i>Isaacs</i> name unto
<i>Rebecca</i>, <i>jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment</i>,
<i>Gen. 24. 53.</i> This custome was in use also among
the <i>Grecians</i>, who calleth these gifts Ἕδνα.<a name="FNanchor_664" id="FNanchor_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a> Moreover<a name="FNanchor_665" id="FNanchor_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>
<i>the chief wife</i> likewise received from her husband
<i>a bill of writing</i>, or <i>matrimonial</i> letters, whereas the
<i>Concubine</i> received neither <i>such gifts</i>, nor such <i>letters</i>.
<i>Thirdly</i>, only <i>the children of the chief wife succeeded the
father in his inheritance; the children of the Concubine
received gifts or legacies</i>: <i>Abraham gave all his goods to
Isaac</i>, but unto the <i>sons of the Concubines</i> which <i>Abraham</i>
had, <i>Abraham gave gifts</i>, <i>Gen. 25. 5, 6.</i> And here, by
the way we may take notice, that <i>the first-born</i> by
right of primogeniture, received a <i>double portion of his
fathers goods</i>, <i>the father shall give him a double portion of
all that he hath for he is the first of his strength</i>, <i>Deut. 21.
17.</i> Unto this custome the <i>Prophet Elisha</i>’s speech alludeth,
when he prayeth <i>Elijah</i>, that his spirit might be
<i>double</i> upon him, <i>2 King. 2. 9.</i> that is that he might have
a <i>double portion of his spirit, in comparison of the other
Prophets</i>, or rather the <i>sons of the Prophets</i>, amongst
whom he obtained the place of an <i>elder brother</i>, and
therefore prayeth for the <i>right of primogeniture</i>: so that
we are not to understand him, as if he did ambitiously
desire a greater measure of the spirit than rested upon
his <i>Master</i>, but that he desired to excel the other <i>remaining
Prophets</i>, unto whom afterward he became a
<i>father</i>. The <i>Hebr.</i> phrase<a name="FNanchor_666" id="FNanchor_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> is in both places the same.
<i>Secondly</i>, in their <i>betrothing</i> we are to consider, 1. The
<i>distance of time</i> between the <i>espousals</i>, and the <i>confirmation</i>
of their marriage, which some have conceited
to have been a <i>full year</i>, at least ten months; and this
they observe from <i>Rebecca</i>, her brother and mothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
answer unto <i>Abrahams</i> servant, desiring that the Maid
might not depart presently, but remain after the Espousals
at least ten dayes, <i>Gen. 24. 55.</i> Which Text
they interpret<a name="FNanchor_667" id="FNanchor_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> <i>ten months</i>, understanding thereby
that which elsewhere is phrased<a name="FNanchor_668" id="FNanchor_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> <i>an year of dayes</i>,
<i>Gen. 41. 1.</i> But if we should yield this interpretation
(although our <i>English</i> <i>at least ten dayes</i> is more agreeable
unto the <i>Septuagint</i> and the <i>Original</i>) yet it followeth
not, that this time was craved for the fulfilling
of any prescribed distance between the Espousals
and the marriage, but rather it implieth the tender
affection of the mother towards her daughter, as
being loath so suddenly to part with her: Notwithstanding,
it is not unlikely that there was a competent
distance of time between the first affiancing, and
the confirmation of the <i>marriage</i>, though not prescribed,
or <i>limited to any set number of dayes</i>, <i>weeks</i>, or
<i>months</i>. The second thing considerable in their betrothings,
is to enquire the <i>manner of their contracting</i>,
which might be done in <i>Israel</i> three ways.<a name="FNanchor_669" id="FNanchor_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> First, <i>By a
piece of money</i>. Secondly, <i>By writing</i>. Thirdly, <i>By copulation</i>,
<i>and all these in the presence of witnesses</i>. <i>By a
piece of money</i>, though it were but a farthing, or the
worth thereof, at which time the man used this, or the
like form of words;<a name="FNanchor_670" id="FNanchor_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> <i>Lo thou art betrothed unto
me</i>: and he gave her the mony before witnesses. <i>By
bill</i>, and then he wrote the like form of words; <i>Be
thou betrothed unto me</i>, which he gave her before witnesses;
and it was written with her name in it, else it
was no betrothing. <i>By copulation</i>, and then he said likewise,
<i>Lo thou shalt be betrothed unto me by copulation</i>,
and so he was united unto her before two witnesses,
after which copulation she was his betrothed wife. If
he lay with her by way of <i>fornication</i>, and not by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
<i>name of betrothing</i>; or if it were by themselves, without
the fore-acquainting of <i>Witnesses</i>, it was no betrothing:
however he might not lye with her the second
time, before the marriage was accomplished.
And though the betrothing might be <i>any of these three
wayes</i>, yet usually it was by a <i>piece of money</i>; and if
they would, they might do it by <i>writing</i>, but betrothing
by copulation was forbidden by the wise
men of <i>Israel</i>, and who so did it was chastised with
rods: howbeit the <i>betrothing</i> stood in force. These
solemnities in <i>betrothing</i> were performed by the man
and woman under a Tent or Canopy made for the
purpose, called in their language <i>Chuppa</i>,<a name="FNanchor_671" id="FNanchor_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> <i>a Tabernacle
or Tent</i>: to this the Psalmist alludeth, <i>Psal. 19.
4, 5.</i> <i>In them hath he set a Tabernacle for the Sun which
as a Bridegroom coming out of his Chamber, rejoyceth
as a strong man to run a Race.</i></p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>, the rites and ceremonies of their marriage
were performed in the assembly of <i>ten men</i> at least,
with blessings and thanksgivings unto <i>God</i>, whence
the house it self was called <i>Beth hillula</i>,<a name="FNanchor_672" id="FNanchor_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> the <i>House of
praise</i> and their marriage song <i>Hillulim</i>,<a name="FNanchor_673" id="FNanchor_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> <i>praises</i>. The
<i>Bridegrooms intimate friends</i> which accompanied him
&amp; sung this <i>Epithalamium</i> or <i>marriage song</i>, were termed
υἱοὶ τοῦ νυμφῶνος, <i>children of the Bride-chamber</i>, <i>Mat.
9. 15.</i> Such I conceive those <i>thirty companions</i> to have
been which <i>Sampson</i> associated to himself, <i>Judg. 14. 11.</i>
The form of this <i>phrase</i> or <i>blessing</i> is at large described
by <i>Genebrard</i>, and the sum thereof is this: The
chief of these companions taketh a cup, and blesseth
it saying <i>Blessed art thou O Lord our God, the King of the
world, w<sup>ch</sup> createst the fruit of the vine</i>: afterward then
he saith, <i>blessed be the Lord our God the King of the world,
who hath created man after his own Image, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the image of his own likeness, &amp; hath therby prepared unto
himself an everlasting building, blessed be thou, O Lord,
who hast created him</i>. Then followeth again, <i>Blessed art
thou, O Lord our God, who hast created joy and gladness,
the Bridegroom and the Bride, charity and brotherly love,
rejoycing and pleasure, peace and society: I beseech thee, O
Lord, let there suddenly be heard in the Cities of Judah,
and the streets of Jerusalem the voice of joy &amp; gladness,
the voice of the bridegroom &amp; the Bride: the voice of exultation
in the bride-chamber is sweeter than any feast:
and children sweeter than the sweetness of a song</i>: and
this being ended, he drinketh to the married couple.</p>

<p>This custome <i>of praising God</i> at such times was not
needless or superfluous, for the <i>fruit of the womb</i> was
expected as a <i>special blessing</i> from God, and so acknowledged
by them in that saying, that <i>four keys</i>
were in the hand of him who was the <i>Lord</i> of the
whole world, which were committed neither to <i>Angel</i>
nor <i>Seraphim</i>; namely <i>Clavis pluviæ, clavis cibationis,
clavis sepulchrorum, &amp; clavis sterilitatis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_674" id="FNanchor_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a>

open your sepulchres</i>, <i>Ezek. 37.</i> Concerning the <i>key of
barrenness</i>, <i>God remembred</i> Rachel <i>and opened her
womb</i>, <i>Gen. 30.</i> Whereby it is intimated, that these four
things <i>God hath reserved in his own hand and custody</i>:
namely, <i>Rain, food, the raising of our bodies and the
procreation of children</i>.</p>

<p>The time <i>of their marriage feast</i> appeareth clearly to
have been <i>usually seven daies</i>.<a name="FNanchor_675" id="FNanchor_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> <i>Sampson</i> continued
his <i>feast seven daies</i>, <i>Judg. 14. 10, 11.</i> And of this <i>seven

<i>Labans unto Jacob</i>, concerning <i>Leah</i>, <i>fulfill her weak</i>,
and we will also give thee this, <i>Gen. 29. 27.</i> in which
speech, it is thought that <i>Laban</i> did desire <i>Jacob</i>, not
to reject and turn away <i>Leah</i>, but to confirm the present
<i>marriage</i>, by fulfilling the <i>usual days of her marriage
feast</i>. From this custom, together with the practise
of <i>Joseph</i>, mourning seven dayes for his father,
<i>Gen. 50. 10.</i> arose that usual proverb among the
<i>Jews</i>, <i>Septem ad convivium, Septem ad luctum</i>. The
chief governor of the feast was called <i>Baal mischte</i>;<a name="FNanchor_677" id="FNanchor_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a>
which name is fitly expressed by being called the
<i>ruler of the feast</i>,<a name="FNanchor_678" id="FNanchor_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> <i>Joh. 2. 9.</i> The <i>modern Jews in Italy</i>,
when they invite any to a <i>marriage feast</i>, use this form
of words, <i>Such a one, or such a one entreateth you to
credit his daughters marriage with your presence at the
feast, &amp;c.</i> Then he which is invited replieth, <i>Mazal
tob</i><a name="FNanchor_679" id="FNanchor_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> which some interpret to be the wishing of <i>good luck</i>
in general, but I rather think, that hereby was wished
to the married parties, <i>a special blessing in the procreation
of children</i>: whence the <i>wedding ring</i>, given
unto the Bride-wife, had this inscription or posie
<i>Mazal tob</i>;<a name="FNanchor_680" id="FNanchor_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> and the <i>Hebrews</i> call the Planet <i>Jupiter</i>,
<i>Mazal</i>, whose influence they thought to be of great
efficacy and force for generation: but in truth, <i>Mazal</i>,
signifieth any other Planet or Star in the Heaven, according
to that <i>Hebrew</i> Proverb,<a name="FNanchor_681" id="FNanchor_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> <i>There is no herb
in the earth, that hath not a Mazal or Star in the Firmament
answering it, and striking it, saying grow</i>. Now
<i>tob</i> signifieth good; so that the phrase soundeth as
much as, <i>be it done in a good hour</i>, or <i>under a good Planet</i>.</p>

<p>At the time of the marriage also, the man gave his
wife a <i>dowery bill</i>, which the <i>Scrivener</i> wrote, and the
Bride-groom paid for, whereby he endowed his
spouse, if she were a <i>Virgin</i>, with 300 Deniers, (that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
fifty shekels) and if she had been married before with
an hundred <i>Deniers</i>, that is twenty five shekels and
this was called the <i>root</i> or <i>principal of the dowry</i>: the
<i>dowry</i> might not be less, but more, so much as he
would, though it were to a talent of gold. There is
mention of a contract between <i>Tobias</i> and <i>Sarah</i>, and
that was performed, <i>not by a Scrivener</i>, but by <i>Raguel</i>,
the womans father; where we may observe, that
before the writing of this bill there was a <i>giving of
the woman unto her husband</i>. The form of words there
used is, <i>Behold, take her after the Law of Moses</i>, <i>Tobit. 7.

<p>After the marriage was finished, then the wife
might challenge from her Husband three things as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
debt. 1. <i>Food.</i> 2. <i>Apparel.</i> 3. <i>Cohabitation</i>, or <i>the
right of the bed</i>; which they note from <i>Exod. 21. 10.</i>
where it is said, If he take him another wife, <i>her food,
her raiment, and her duty of marriage shall he not diminish</i>.
And unto this the <i>Apostle</i> alludeth, calling it
<i>Due benevolence</i>, <i>1 Cor. 7. 3.</i></p>

<p>The Wife, when she was first presented unto her
Husband, covered her Head with a <i>veil</i>, in token of
<i>subjection</i>. <i>Rebecca</i> took a <i>veil</i>, and covered her self,
(<i>Gen. 24. 65.</i>) and for this cause (namely in <i>sign of subjection</i>)
ought the woman to have power on her head,
<i>1 Cor. 11. 10.</i> where by <i>Power</i> the <i>Apostle</i> understandeth
a <i>veil</i>. Do any ask the question, why he
should denote this <i>veil</i> by the name of <i>power</i>, especially
seeing it was in <i>token of subjection</i>? The <i>Apostle</i>
being an <i>Hebrew</i> of the <i>Hebrews</i>, might have respect
to the <i>Hebrew</i> word <i>Radid</i>,<a name="FNanchor_683" id="FNanchor_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> signifying a <i>veil</i>, which
cometh from the root <i>Radad</i>, to bear <i>rule and authority</i>,
and so might use the Greek word,<a name="FNanchor_684" id="FNanchor_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> signifying
<i>power</i> in the same sense as the <i>Hebrews</i> did. And,
in truth, what was this subjection to the husband but a
kind of <i>power</i> and <i>protection</i> derived unto the <i>Wife</i>,
in comparison of her former state, being a <i>Virgin</i>?
and therefore in case her husband was jealous of her,
among other tokens of sorrow, she was commanded
to stand at her tryal with her <i>head uncovered</i>,<a name="FNanchor_685" id="FNanchor_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> <i>Numb.
5. 18.</i> intimating thereby, that if she could not then
clear her self, she was from thenceforward deprived
of all <i>power</i>, which heretofore she enjoyed by the
means of her Husband.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>, they washed the body being dead. <i>Tabitha
died, and when they had washed her, they laid her in an
upper-chamber</i>, <i>Act. 9. 37.</i> The <i>baptization</i> or <i>washing</i>
at such a time was threefold. The first was βαπτισμὸς
ἀπὸ νεκρῶν, <i>Eccles. 34. 26.</i> <i>A washing from the pollution
contracted by the touch of a dead carkass</i>; that if haply
any ignorantly and unawares became thus unclean,
then was he by a kind of washing to be made clean again.
The second was βαπτισμὸς τῶν νεκρῶν, <i>a baptization
or washing of the dead Corps it self</i>. Thus <i>Tabitha</i> was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
<i>washed</i>: neither is the word βαπτισμὸς, unusually applied
to <i>common washings</i>, as <i>Mar. 7. 4.</i> we read of the
<i>washing of cups, pots, vessels, tables</i>, the <i>Greek is</i> βαπτισμὸς.
The <i>first</i> of these washings was proper to the <i>Jews</i>:
this second in use with <i>Jews</i> <i>Christians</i>,<a name="FNanchor_694" id="FNanchor_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> and <i>Heathens</i>:<a name="FNanchor_695" id="FNanchor_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a>
the <i>third</i> (which was βαπτισμὸς ὑπὲρ τῶν νεκρῶν, <i>a
baptization for the dead</i>, <i>1 Cor. 15. 9.</i>) proper to some
<i>amiss-led Christians</i>. It may be demanded, what
manner of <i>Baptism</i> this was? with submission of my
judgment, I understand this place with S. <i>Ambrose</i><a name="FNanchor_696" id="FNanchor_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a>
of a <i>Sacramental washing</i>, applied unto some living
man in the name and behalf of his friend, dying
without <i>Baptism</i>, out of a superstitious conceit, that
the Sacrament thus conferred to one alive, in the
name of the deceased, might be available for the other
dying <i>unbaptized</i>. As if the Apostle did wound
those superstitious <i>Corinthians</i> with their own quills,
and prove the Resurrection of the dead from their
own erroneous practice, telling them in effect, that
their superstitious custome of <i>baptizing</i> the living
for the dead, were vain and bootless, if there were
no resurrection, and therefore the Apostle useth an
emphatical <i>distinction of the persons</i>, in the next immediate
verse, saying, why are we also in jeopardy
every hour? he inferreth the resurrection by force
of a <i>double</i> argument; the <i>first</i> drawn from their superstitious
<i>baptization</i> for the dead: the <i>second</i>, from
the hourly jeopardy and peril wherein we, that is,
himself and other <i>Christians</i> are. So that as that
<i>Father</i> noteth, the Apostle doth not hereby <i>approve</i>
their doing, but evinceth their hope of the resurrection
from their own practice, though erroneous.
That there was <i>Vicarium tale Baptisma</i> (as <i>Tertullian</i><a name="FNanchor_697" id="FNanchor_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a>
calleth it) in use among the <i>Marcionites</i>, is evident,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
yea, and among the <i>Corinthians</i><a name="FNanchor_698" id="FNanchor_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> also: the manner
thereof is thus described:<a name="FNanchor_699" id="FNanchor_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> <i>When any Catechumenist
died, some living person placed under the bed of
the deceased, they came unto the deceased party, and asked
him whether he would be baptized: then he replying
nothing, the party under the bed answered for him, saying
that he would be baptized: and thus they baptized
him for the dead, as if they acted a play upon the Stage</i>.</p>

<p>The <i>third</i> ceremony used by the <i>Jews</i> towards the
dead party, was the <i>embalming</i> of the corps, which
for the main thereof, it is probable they learned
from the <i>Egyptians</i>, for we find <i>Joseph</i> to be the first
that practised it, <i>Gen. 50. 2.</i> The <i>Egyptian</i> manner of
<i>embalming</i> was thus:<a name="FNanchor_700" id="FNanchor_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> <i>they took out the bowels of the
dead, they cleansed them and washed them with the wine
of Dates, and after that again with odors: then filled they
the bowels with pure Myrrh beaten, and Cassia, and other
Odors (except Frankincense) and sewed them up. After
this they seasoned the corps hidden in Nitre seventy days,
not longer: after seventy days they washed the corps, and
wrapped it in fine linnen cloth gummed, which gum the
Egyptians often used instead of glew.</i> The <i>Greeks</i> termed
this ταριχεύειν. And the use thereof was for the <i>preservation</i>
of the body, that it might not putrifie; and
therefore when the Funeral Obsequies were not long
delayed, they used another kind of <i>embalming</i>, namely,
an external and outward application of Spices and
Odours, without the unbowelling of the corps. This
the <i>Greeks</i> termed ἐνταφιάζειν.<a name="FNanchor_701" id="FNanchor_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> This was used toward
our <i>Saviour Christ</i>, <i>John 19. 40.</i></p>

<p>Sometimes they did use to <i>burn the corps</i>, preserving
onely the bones in some urn or pitcher, <i>Amos 6.
10.</i> But commonly they interred the whole body,
and buried it in the earth. The ancient <i>Jews</i> if they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
received not from their Ancestors, then would they
purchase a <i>burial place</i> themselves, for the burial of
them and their family. The form of that place was
thus: It was a <i>vault</i> hewed out in a rock,<a name="FNanchor_702" id="FNanchor_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> six cubits
long, and four broad, in which eight other cells
or lesser holes (or as some say, thirteen) were made,
as so many distinct receptacles, or <i>tombs</i> for the dead
bodies to be laid in: as often as they buried any, they
were wont to <i>roll a great stone to the mouth of the cave</i>.
The <i>cave</i> or <i>vault</i> it self they termed from the act of
burial, <i>Keber</i>,<a name="FNanchor_703" id="FNanchor_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a> which signifieth a place of burial,
or from its form, <i>Magnara</i>,<a name="FNanchor_704" id="FNanchor_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> <i>a den or cave</i>. These several
cells or receptacles in which the body was laid,
they called <i>cucim</i>,<a name="FNanchor_705" id="FNanchor_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a> <i>graves, tombs</i>: and the <i>stone</i>
they named <i>Golel</i>,<a name="FNanchor_706" id="FNanchor_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> <i>a rolling stone</i>. This giveth great
light to that in the <i>Gospel</i>. <i>Joseph</i> took the body of
<i>Christ</i>, and wrapped it in a clean linnen cloth, and
put it in his <i>new tomb</i>, which he had hewen out in
a rock, and <i>rolled a great stone to the door of the Sepulchre</i>,
<i>Mat. 27. 59, 60.</i> These <i>caves</i> or <i>vaults</i> the wealthier
sort would <i>paint</i>, <i>garnish</i>, and <i>beautifie</i> at the
mouth or enterance of them: hence cometh that
phrase, <i>Sepulchra dealbata</i>, <i>painted tombs</i>. As often as

<p>The latter <i>Jews</i> have been strangely conceited
concerning the place of burials, and are perswaded
that if an <i>Israelite</i> be buried in any strange country,
out of the promised Land, he shall not be partaker
so much as of Resurrection, except the Lord vouchsafe
to make him <i>hollow passages</i>, under the earth, thorow
which his body by a continual volutation and
rolling, may be brought into the land of <i>Canaan</i>. The
ground hereof is taken from the charge of <i>Jacob</i> unto
his son <i>Joseph</i>, that he should not bury him in the
land of <i>Egypt</i>, but in <i>Canaan</i>. For which charge
they assign three reasons.<a name="FNanchor_709" id="FNanchor_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a> <i>First</i>, because he foresaw
by the spirit of Prophecy, that the dust of that land
should afterward be turned into lice. <i>Secondly</i>, because
those who died out of the holy Land should
not rise again without a painful rolling and tumbling
of their bodies thorow those hollow passages.
<i>Thirdly</i>, that the <i>Egyptians</i> might not idolatrously
worship him.</p>

<p>They made a feast at their burials, which is stiled
<i>The bread of men</i>, <i>Ezek. 14. 17.</i> And a <i>cup of consolation</i>,
<i>Jer. 16. 7.</i> because it was administred to comfort those
that were sad of heart. It much resembled the <i>Roman
Silicernium</i>.</p>

<p>From those two places last quoted, we may observe,
that at the burial of their friends, they used
these ceremonies which follow; some to <i>testifie</i>, some
to <i>augment</i> their grief. 1. <i>Cutting themselves</i>, that is,
wounding or cutting any part of their body, with any
kind of Instrument. This practice was learned
from the <i>Heathens</i>,<a name="FNanchor_710" id="FNanchor_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> who were wont not only to scratch
their face, but to punch and prick certain parts of
their body with a needle, and then cover it over with
ink, which they used as a special ceremony in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
superstitious worship, and therefore it is forbid, <i>Deut.
14. 1.</i> <i>Secondly, making themselves bald</i>,<a name="FNanchor_711" id="FNanchor_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> which was
done divers manner of ways; either by <i>shaving their
hair</i>, or <i>plucking it off</i> with their hands, or by <i>impoisoned
plaister to make it fall off</i>. Other Nations were
wont to shave off the hair of their head, and to
offer it in the behalf of the dead: they did sometimes
shave their cheeks, sometimes their eye-lids:
and this also, being an <i>Heathenish</i> custome, was likewise
forbidden in <i>Israel</i>, <i>Deut. 14. 1.</i> <i>Thirdly, going
bare headed</i>, that they might cast dust or ashes upon
their heads, signifying thereby that they <i>were unworthy
the ground on which they went. Fourthly, going barefooted</i>
for their greater humiliation. <i>Fifthly, the covering
of their lips</i>, for that was a special sign of sorrow
and shame, <i>The Seers shall be ashamed</i>, &amp;c. they
shall all cover their lips, for they have no answer of
God, <i>Mich. 3. 7.</i> If it be demanded, how they covered
their lips? It is thought<a name="FNanchor_712" id="FNanchor_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a> they did it <i>by casting the
skirt of their cloak, or garment over them. Sixthly,<a name="FNanchor_713" id="FNanchor_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a>
renting their cloaths. Seventhly, putting sackcloth about
their loyns</i>, <i>Gen. 37. 34.</i> These were general tokens of
grief, used upon all extroardinary occasions of sorrow.
Two other there were, more proper to burials,
to augment their grief. <i>First, Minstrels</i>, who with
their sad tunes inclined the affections of the people
to mourning.<a name="FNanchor_714" id="FNanchor_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> Of these there were <i>two sorts</i>: Some
playing on <i>pipes</i>, others sounding <i>trumpets</i>. At the
funeral of Noblemen, or old men, they used a <i>trumpet</i>:
at the funeral of the common people, or children,
they used a <i>pipe</i>.<a name="FNanchor_715" id="FNanchor_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> In this respect it is said;
<i>That Jesus, when he raised</i> Jairus <i>his daughter, cast out
the Minstrels</i>, Mat. 9. 23. <i>Secondly</i>, women hired to sing
at burials for the same purpose, and likewise by outward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
significations of sorrow, to move the company,
and more strongly to affect them, <i>Call for the mourning
women</i>, &amp;c. <i>and send for skilful women</i>, <i>Jer. 9. 17.</i>
These the <i>Romans</i> called, <i>Præficas, quasi in hoc ipsum
præfectas</i>, <i>Chief or skilful mourners</i>.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of their Oaths.</i></span></h3>

<p>The manner of <i>swearing</i> was sometimes by <i>lifting
up their hands towards heaven</i>; <i>Abraham</i> said
to the <i>King of Sodom</i>, <i>I have lifted up my hand unto
the Lord</i>; that is, I have <i>sworn</i>, that I will not take
from a thred, even to a shoe-latchet, <i>Gen. 14. 22.</i>
Unto which custome the Psalmist seemeth to allude,
<i>Psal. 106. 26.</i> <i>He lifted up his hand</i>, that is, <i>he swore</i>.
Sometimes he that took the Oath <i>did put his hand
under the others thigh</i>, which administred the Oath.
We read this manner of administration to have been
used by <i>Abraham</i>, <i>Gen. 24. 2.</i> and <i>Jacob</i>, <i>Gen. 47. 29.</i>
Which ceremony some<a name="FNanchor_716" id="FNanchor_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> interpret to be as a <i>token
of subjection</i>; others<a name="FNanchor_717" id="FNanchor_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> as a <i>mystery of circumcision</i>;
the sign wherof they bore about that place of their
body: Others<a name="FNanchor_718" id="FNanchor_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a> more probably think it to be a <i>mysterious
signification of Christ the promised seed</i>, who was
to come out of <i>Abrahams loyns</i>, or <i>thigh</i>; as the like
phrase is used, <i>Gen. 46. 26.</i> the souls that came out of
<i>Jacobs thigh</i>. Sometimes also the manner of deposing,
was to <i>stand before the Altar</i>, <i>1 Kings 8. 31.</i> Which
was also the custome of the <i>Athenians</i>,<a name="FNanchor_719" id="FNanchor_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> the
<i>Carthaginians</i>,<a name="FNanchor_720" id="FNanchor_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> and the <i>Romans</i>.<a name="FNanchor_721" id="FNanchor_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a></p>

<p>The object of a lawful Oath was, and is, <i>onely the
Lord</i>: whence he that took the Oath was said to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
<i>confess unto God</i>, compare <i>Isa. 45. 23.</i> with <i>Rom. 14. 11.</i>
And the ancient form of imposing an Oath was this,
<i>Give glory to God</i>, <i>Josh. 7. 19.</i> <i>John. 9. 24.</i> Now God
was glorified by an Oath, because thereby there was
a solemn confession and acknowledgement of <i>Gods
Omni-presence</i>, that he is present in every place: of his
<i>Omniscience</i>, that he knoweth all secrets: of his <i>truth</i>,
that he is <i>a maintainer of truth</i>, and <i>an avenger of
falshood</i>: of his <i>justice</i>, that he is willing; and his <i>omnipotency</i>,
that he is able to punish those that by swearing
shall dishonour him, And as the <i>object of a lawful
oath</i> was onely <i>God</i>: so it is implied, that it was not
rashly or unadvisedly to be undertaken, but by a
kind of necessity <i>imposed</i>; for the <i>Hebrew</i> word ‎‏נשבע‏‎
is a Passive, and signifieth <i>to be sworn</i>, rather than to
<i>swear</i>.</p>

<p>In corrupter times they were wont to swear by the
<i>creatures</i>,<a name="FNanchor_722" id="FNanchor_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> but the <i>Jews</i> chiefly by <i>Jerusalem, by the
Temple, by the gold of the Temple, by the Altar, and the
gift on the Altar</i>. This <i>gift</i> in <i>Hebrew</i> was termed <i>Corban</i>,<a name="FNanchor_723" id="FNanchor_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a>
and it was one of those oaths which in our <i>Saviour
Christs</i> time the <i>Scribes</i> and <i>Pharisees</i> accounted
principally obligatory. If any swore <i>by the Altar</i>, it was
nothing: but if any swore by the <i>oblation of the Altar</i>,
he was bound to perform it, <i>Matth. 23. 18.</i> Yea, although
<i>Gods law</i> enjoyned honour, and relief toward
parents; yet if they had bound themselves by this
oath <i>Corban</i>, that they would not help or relieve their
parents, they taught they were discharged. Whence,
saith their <i>Talmud</i>,<a name="FNanchor_724" id="FNanchor_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> <i>Every one ought to honour his father
and mother, except he hath vowed the contrary</i>. And
it is evident<a name="FNanchor_725" id="FNanchor_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a> that the <i>Jews</i> did often by solemn vows
and <i>oaths bind themselves, that they would never do
good to such, or such a man</i>. We must furthermore know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
that usually to their oaths there was an <i>execration</i>,
or <i>conditional curse</i> annexed, which sometimes was
expressed, as, <i>if I do not do thus and thus, then the Lord
do so to me, and more also</i>, <i>1 Sam. 14. 44.</i> Also <i>1 Kin.
20. 10.</i> Sometimes it is <i>understood</i>, as, <i>I have sworn, if
I take from a thred to a shoo-latchet</i>, <i>Gen. 14. 22.</i> <i>then
let the Lord do so to me, and more also</i>; this, or the like,
is <i>understood</i> and maketh the former part of the oath
to sound negatively; as if <i>Abraham</i> had said, <i>I have
sworn, I will not take from a thread to a shoo-latchet</i>. In
like manner, <i>Psal. 95.</i> I have sworn, <i>if they shall enter
into my rest</i>; that is, <i>They shall not enter into my rest</i>,
<i>Heb. 3. 18.</i> This helpeth the exposition of that difficult
place, <i>Mat. 15. 5.</i> which we read,<a name="FNanchor_726" id="FNanchor_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a> <i>By the gift that is
offered by me thou maist have profit</i>: but if we conceive
it thus, according to the form of the oath <i>Corban</i>, <i>By
Corban if thou receive any profit by me</i>, and understand
the execration implyed: <i>Then let God do thus, and
much more to me</i>; the sense will be thus; <i>By Corban
thou shalt receive no profit by me</i>. This exposition is as
agreeable to the scope of the place, as it is to their
form of swearing, and plainly sheweth how the <i>Pharisees</i>
by their traditions transgressed the Commandment
of God. For God commanded, saying, <i>Honour
thy father and Mother.</i> But the <i>Scribes</i> and <i>Pharisees</i>
said; Whosoever should say to father or mother
seeking relief, <i>By Corban thou shalt receive no profit
from me</i>, he was discharged.</p>

<p>In like manner, the matter upon which men
wrote, in ruder times was different. Some wrote on
<i>rinds of trees</i>, whence <i>Liber</i>, signifying originally a
<i>rinde of a tree</i>, is now used for <i>a book</i>:<a name="FNanchor_733" id="FNanchor_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> some wrote
on <i>tile-stone</i> with a <i>bone</i> instead of a <i>pen</i>; some on
<i>Tables</i>; this last was chiefly in use among the <i>Jews</i>,
the <i>Decalogue</i> was was written in two <i>tables</i>. Again,
write these things upon a <i>table</i>, <i>Esay. 30. 8.</i> ἐπὶ πυξίου,
saith the <i>Septuagint</i>, as if the writing-tables at that
time were made of <i>Box-trees</i>. They used not then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
<i>pens</i> or <i>quills</i>, but a certain instrument or <i>punch</i>, made
of Iron or Steel, called <i>Stylus</i>, it was sharp at one
end, for the more convenient indenting or carving
of the characters, and broad at the other, for the
scraping or blotting out what had been written:
whence sprang that Proverbial speech:<a name="FNanchor_734" id="FNanchor_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> <i>Invertere
stylum</i>, <i>to unsay what he had said</i>, or <i>to blot out what he
hath written</i>: <i>Scribe stilo hominis</i>: <i>write with the pen
of man</i>, <i>Esay. 8. 1.</i> Afterward before they came to
bind up books in manner as now we have them,
they wrote in a roll of <i>Paper</i> or <i>Parchment</i>, which
sometimes was <i>ten cubits</i> broad, and <i>twenty</i> long, <i>Zac.
5. 2.</i> This they called ‎‏מגלה‏‎ <i>Megilla</i>, in <i>Hebrew</i>, from
<i>Galal</i>, <i>to roll</i>, <i>Volumen</i> <i>in Latine</i>, in <i>English a volumn</i>,
from <i>volvo</i>, <i>to roll</i>. In the <i>volumn of the book</i> it is written,
<i>Psal. 40. 7.</i> And <i>Christ closing</i> the Book, gave it
to the Minister, <i>Luk. 4. 20.</i> the word is πτύξας, <i>complicans</i>
<i>folding</i>, or rolling it up: and <i>vers. 17.</i> ἀναπτύξας,
<i>explicans</i>, <i>unfolding</i>, or opening it.<a name="FNanchor_735" id="FNanchor_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> These <i>volumns</i>
were written not with one entire continued writing,
but the writing was distinguished into many <i>spaces</i>,
<i>columns</i> or <i>platforms</i>, like unto so many <i>Areæ</i>: these
<i>platforms</i>, filled with writing, were instead of so many
<i>pages</i> in a book: and thus we are to understand
that <i>Jer. 36. 23.</i> When <i>Jehudi</i> had read three or four
<i>leaves</i>, he cut it with a pen-knife, <i>&amp;c.</i> These <i>leaves</i>
were nothing else but such <i>spaces</i>, and platforms in the
<i>roll</i>. After this manner the <i>Jews</i> reserve the Law
written in such <i>rolls</i>, and with such <i>spaces</i>, in their
<i>Synagogues</i> at this day.</p>

<p>It is much controversed, whether the <i>Jews</i> did
from the beginning write with <i>vowels</i> and <i>accents</i>, or
whether they were added by the <i>Masorites</i>; for the
understanding of which, it will be needful, <i>First</i>, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
enquire who the <i>Masorites</i> were: <i>Secondly</i>, what their
work was; and then to deliver in a proposition what
may be probably thought in this point.</p>

<p>First, concerning the <i>Masorites</i>, we are to know
that ‎‏מסר‏‎ <i>Masar</i> signifieth <i>tradere</i>, <i>to deliver</i>, and <i>Masor</i>
<i>a tradition</i>, delivered from hand to hand to posterity
without writing, as the <i>Pythagoreans</i> and <i>Druides</i>
were wont to do; but by the figure <i>Synecdoche</i>,
it signifieth those <i>critical notes</i> or <i>Scholion</i>, written in
the margine of the Bible, and those that were the
Authors of those <i>critical observations</i> were termed
<i>Masoritæ</i>, <i>Masorites</i>. Concerning these Authors, who
they were there are two opinions. Some<a name="FNanchor_736" id="FNanchor_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> think that
they were certain learned <i>Jews</i> living in the City <i>Tiberias</i>,
they termed them <i>Sapientes Tiberiadis</i>, <i>the wise
men of Tiberias</i>. These <i>wise men</i> are thought to have
added these <i>marginal notes</i> unto the <i>Hebrew Bibles</i><a name="FNanchor_737" id="FNanchor_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a>
some time after the finishing of the <i>Babylon Talmud</i>,
which was about the year of our <i>Lord</i>, 506. This
opinion is unlikely for these two reasons. 1.<a name="FNanchor_738" id="FNanchor_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> Because
we cannot find in Histories, the continuance
of any Colledg or School in <i>Tiberias</i> so long, but rather
that <i>degrees in learning</i> ceased there within four
hundred years after our <i>Saviour his birth</i>. 2.<a name="FNanchor_739" id="FNanchor_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> In
both <i>Talmuds</i> mention is made of the <i>Masora</i>, and the
things contained therein. Others therefore more
probably say,<a name="FNanchor_740" id="FNanchor_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> that the <i>Masorites</i> were that <i>Ecclesiastical
Senate</i> or <i>Council</i> held by <i>Esra, Haggai, Zachary,
Malachi</i>, and divers others assembled for the reformation
of the Church after their return from <i>Babylon</i>;
they are called <i>Viri Synagogæ magnæ</i>. This <i>Council</i>
continued at least forty years: for <i>Simeon the
just</i>, who went out in his <i>Priestly robes</i>, to meet and
pacifie <i>Alexander the Great</i>, coming in hostile manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
against <i>Jerusalem</i>,<a name="FNanchor_741" id="FNanchor_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> was the last of that <i>Council</i>,
and that was above three hundred years before the
birth of our <i>Saviour</i>. <i>Esra</i> was the <i>President</i> or Chief
of this <i>Council</i>; he was of such repute among the
<i>Jews</i>, that they parallel’d him with <i>Moses</i>, saying,<a name="FNanchor_742" id="FNanchor_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a>
<i>Dignus erat</i> Esra, <i>quod data fuisset lex per manus
ejus</i> Israeli, <i>si non præcessisset eum</i> Moses.</p>

<p>In the second place we are to consider the <i>work</i>,
what the men of this great <i>Synagogue</i>, being the true
<i>Masorites</i>, did: their work may be reduced to these
particulars. 1. When this great <i>Council</i> was assembled,
they, among whom <i>Ezra</i> was chief (who was
assisted with the inspiration of <i>Gods Spirit</i>)<a name="FNanchor_743" id="FNanchor_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> determined
what <i>Books</i> were <i>Canonical</i>, what <i>spurious</i> and
<i>Apocryphal</i>. <i>Secondly</i>,<a name="FNanchor_744" id="FNanchor_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> the <i>authentick</i> and <i>Canonical
Books</i>, were purged by them, of all errors crept into
the Text in time of their captivity. <i>Thirdly</i>,<a name="FNanchor_745" id="FNanchor_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a> they
digested the <i>Old Testament</i> into <i>twenty two books</i>, according
to the number of the <i>Hebrew letters</i>. <i>Fourthly</i>,
they distinguisht it into great <i>Sections</i> and <i>Verses</i>; for
though the Law was not so confusedly written,
without any space or note of distinction between
word and word that it seemed all one <i>continued verse</i>,
or as the <i>Kabbalists</i> speak, ‎‏תיבה אחת‏‎ <i>Theba achath</i>,
<i>one word</i>, until the time of the <i>Masorites</i>; yet it was
not so distinguisht into <i>Sections</i> and <i>Verses</i>, as now
we have it. <i>Fifthly</i>, they added their censures and
<i>critical observations</i>, concerning the irregularity of
many words, in respect of the <i>vowels</i> and <i>accents</i>.
<i>Sixthly</i>, they numbered the <i>verses</i>, <i>words</i>, and <i>letters</i>
of every Book, to prevent all possibility of corrupting
the Text in future times; for now they say, the gift
of Prophesie should cease. <i>Lastly</i>, they noted the <i>different
writing</i>, and <i>different reading</i>, for the understanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
of which we must know, that in the <i>Hebrew</i>
Text many words are written with more, many with
<i>fewer letters</i>, than they are pronounced; many
words <i>written</i> in the Text which are not <i>pronounced,
&amp;c.</i><a name="FNanchor_746" id="FNanchor_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> In the margin the difference is expressed: whence
the difference in the Text they term ‎‏כתב‏‎ <i>Cethib</i>,
<i>Scriptionem</i>, the writing; the difference in the margin
they term ‎‏קרי‏‎ <i>Keri</i>, <i>Lectionem</i>, the Reading: because
they do read according to that in the margin.
This difference is thought by some<a name="FNanchor_747" id="FNanchor_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a> to be a correction
of the Bible, according to several copies after
their return from <i>Babylon</i>: but, that it is of <i>Divine
Authority</i>, containing many mysteries known to <i>Moses</i>,
and the <i>Prophets</i> successively (though many of
them unknown to our Age) and that it was not any
correction, but the difference it self primarily and
purposely was intended by the <i>Prophets</i>, and holy
Penmen of the Scripture, evidently appeareth by the
diversity of readings in those books which were written
by <i>Haggai</i>, <i>Zachary</i>, <i>Malachi</i>, <i>Daniel</i>, and <i>Esra</i>:
They being the Authors of their own books, needed
no <i>correction</i> at that time, themselves being present,
yet in them this <i>different reading</i> is used.</p>

<p>In the third place, the Proposition followeth;
namely, <i>Seeing that the</i> Masorites <i>passed their censure
on many words for their irregularity in their vowels
and accents</i>; therefore, <i>the vowels originally were
not from the</i> Masorites, <i>but of the same antiquity with
their words</i>; and in truth, otherwise they had been
a <i>body or carkass without a soul</i>.</p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Of Israels pitching their Tents, or of
their Camps.</i></span></h3>

<p>Whiles the <i>Israelites</i> wandred thorow the
Wilderness, their <i>Church</i> was a <i>Tabernacle</i>;
and their <i>habitations</i>, <i>Tents</i>: so that their whole
<i>Camp</i> might be termed a <i>moveable City</i>. It was divided
into three parts. In the centre or middle of all
was the <i>Tabernacle</i> it self, with its <i>Courts</i>, this they
termed the <i>Camp of the Divine Majesty</i>. Next round
about, pitcht the <i>Priests</i> and <i>Levites</i>, to whom the
charge of the <i>Tabernacle</i> belonged, (and therefore
the nearest adjoyning place of habitation might be
the convenientest for them) this was called the <i>camp
of Levi</i>. In the utter parts, round about <i>Levi</i>, the
<i>twelve Tribes</i> pitcht their Tents; this they termed the
<i>Camp of Israel</i>. The first <i>Camp</i> resembled a great
<i>Cathedral Church</i>, with its <i>Church-yard</i>. The <i>second</i> a
Priviledg-place <i>about the Church</i>, as it were for <i>Colledges</i>
for the habitation of the <i>Clergy</i>. The <i>third</i>, the
<i>body of a City</i>, wherein the <i>Towns-men</i> or <i>Laity</i> dwelt.
The form of the whole, is probably thought to be
<i>four-square</i>, some say <i>twelve miles long</i>, and
<i>twelve miles broad</i>.<a name="FNanchor_748" id="FNanchor_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a></p>

<p>Thus have we seen how they pitch’d their <i>camps</i>,
their <i>marching</i> followeth: and here we are to consider,
first, their <i>marching in their journeys</i> thorow the
Wilderness. Secondly, their <i>marching in their battels</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Concerning their <i>marching in their journeys</i>, they
either <i>moved forward</i>, or <i>abode still</i>, according to the
moving or standing of the Cloud, which conducted
them: the manner thereof is described, <i>Numb. 10.</i>
and summarily we may view it thus: when <i>God</i>
took up the Cloud, <i>Moses</i> prayed, and the <i>Priests</i>
with Trumpets blew an alarm, then <i>Judah</i> the first
Standard rose up, with <i>Issachar</i> and <i>Zebulon</i>, and they
<i>marched foremost</i>: then followed the <i>Gershonites</i> and
<i>Merarites</i>, bearing the boards and coverings of the
<i>Tabernacle</i> in wagons; the Trumpets sounded the
second alarm, then <i>Reuben</i>, <i>Simeon</i>, and <i>Gad</i> rose up
and <i>followed the Tabernacle</i>, and after them went the
<i>Kohathites</i>, in the midst of the <i>twelve Tribes</i>, bearing
on their shoulders the <i>Ark, Candlestick, Table, Altar</i>,
and other holy things. At the third alarm rose up
the <i>Standard of Ephraim</i>, <i>Manasses</i>, and <i>Benjamin</i>, and
these followed the <i>Sanctuary</i>: unto this <i>David</i> hath
reference, when he prayeth, <i>Psa. 80. 2.</i> <i>Before Ephraim,
Benjamin, and Manasses</i>, stir up thy strength,
and come and save us. At the fourth alarm, arose
the <i>Standard of Dan</i>, <i>Asher</i>, and <i>Napthali</i>: and to these
was committed the care of gathering together the
lame, feeble, and sick, and to look that nothing was
left behind: whence they are called the <i>gathering
Host</i>, <i>Josh. 6. 9.</i> unto this <i>David</i> alludeth: when my
Father and my Mother forsake me, the <i>Lord</i> will <i>gather</i>
me, <i>Psal. 27. 10.</i></p>

<p>Concerning their <i>marching in War</i>: <i>First</i>, the
<i>Priests</i> sounded the alarm with Trumpets, <i>Num. 10. 9.</i>
this they termed: <i>Therugnah</i>.<a name="FNanchor_758" id="FNanchor_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> <i>Secondly</i>, one <i>Priest</i>
was selected out of the rest, to stir up the hearts
of the people, and by a kind of hortatory Oration,
to encourage them to the war, <i>Deut. 20. 2.</i> him they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
called <i>Unctum belli</i>, <i>the anointed of the battel</i>. <i>Thirdly</i>,
they marched on by five and five in battel-array, <i>Exo.
13. 18.</i> so the Original signifieth in that place.<a name="FNanchor_759" id="FNanchor_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a></p>

<p>In the last place, we are to consider how they were
to deal in besieging a Town; for the conceiving
whereof, note these two propositions.</p>

<p>1. <i>They were to offer peace unto all Forreigners, and
Canaanites</i>, <i>Deut. 20. 10.</i> And this is clearly signified
<i>Josh. 11. 19.</i> There was not a City that made peace
with the Children of <i>Israel</i>, save the <i>Hivites</i>, the inhabitants
of <i>Gibeon</i>, all other they took in battel.
For it was of the <i>Lord</i> to harden their hearts. Yet
here <i>Moab</i> and <i>Ammon</i> are excepted; <i>Israel must not
seek their peace</i>, <i>Deut. 23. 6.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>They were to make covenant with none of the seven
Nations</i>, <i>Deut. 7. 2.</i> <i>Exod. 23. 32. &amp; 34. 14.</i> With <i>Forreigners
they might</i>, <i>Josh. 9. 17.</i> peradventure you <i>dwell
among us</i>, and how shall we <i>make a covenant</i> with
you? Not, how shall we <i>make peace with you</i>?</p>

<p>Some may question, what the difference was between
<i>making peace</i>, and <i>making a covenant</i>? I answer,
<i>two fold</i>. 1. The <i>making of peace</i> was a naked stipulation,
or promise, mutually made for the laying
aside of all hostile affections towards each other;
whereby life on both sides might be secured. <i>Making
a covenant</i>, was a solemn binding of each other, to
performance of this mutual promise by outward ceremonies,<a name="FNanchor_760" id="FNanchor_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a>
of cutting a beast in twain, and passing between
the parts thereof, <i>Jer. 34. 18.</i> as if they would
say; <i>Thus let it be done to him, and thus let his body be
cut in two, who shall break this covenant</i>? Secondly,
peace was not concluded by the <i>Israelites</i>, but only
upon these terms, <i>That the People should become tributary
unto them</i>, <i>Deut. 20. 11.</i> The <i>making of a covenant</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
was upon equal terms, without any condition
either of tribute or service, as is gatherable from
the <i>Covenant</i> made by <i>Joshua</i> with the <i>Gibeonites</i>,
where there is no mention of any condition at all,
<i>Josh. 9.</i></p>

<p>This difference seemeth to me warrantable, and
serveth to reconcile many places of Scripture, as
where <i>God</i> saith, <i>Offer peace to all</i>, and <i>make a covenant
with none</i>. <i>Secondly</i>, It sheweth the fraud of the <i>Gibeonites</i>
to be greater than is commonly conceived,
for they sought not <i>peace simply</i>, but <i>a covenant</i>. <i>Make
a league with us</i>, <i>Josh. 9. 6.</i> <i>Thirdly</i>, It salveth that common
Objection made in defence of <i>unadvised Oaths</i>,
to prove them <i>obligatory</i>, though <i>unlawful</i>. The Argument
is framed thus; <i>The covenant which <span class="antiqua">Joshua</span>
made with the Gibeonites unadvisedly, was unlawful: but
that was observed by him, and the breach thereof, when
<span class="antiqua">Saul</span> slew the Gibeonites, punished by God</i>, <i>2 Sam. 21. 1.</i>
<i>Therefore, &amp;c.</i> I say it salveth that Objection: because
if we diligently observe <i>Joshua</i>’s practise, we shall
find <i>unadvised Oaths</i> to be so far, and <i>only so far binding</i>,
as they agree with <i>God</i>’s <i>words</i>. <i>God</i>’s <i>word</i> required
the <i>Gibeonites</i> should have their lives secured,
because they accepted <i>peace</i>; Thus far therefore the
<i>covenant was still of force</i>. <i>God</i>’s <i>word</i> required, that
the <i>Canaanites</i>, after the acceptation of peace, should
become <i>tributary</i>; here the <i>covenant was not of force</i>,
and therefore <i>Joshuah</i> made them <i>hewers of wood, and
drawers of water</i>, which is a kind of tribute in the
language of the Scripture, a tribute of the <i>body</i>,
though not of the <i>purse</i>: in which sense the <i>Ægyptian
Task-Masters</i> are in the Original called <i>Tribute-masters</i>,
<i>Exod. 1. 11.</i></p>

<span class="smaller"><i>Their Measures.</i></span></h3>

<p><i>Measures</i> in use among the <i>Hebrews</i>, and so among
all other <i>Nations</i>, are of <i>two sorts</i>: some <i>Mensuræ
applicationis</i>, <i>measures of application</i>, as, a span, a
cubit, a yard, and the like. Secondly, <i>Mensuræ capacitatis</i>,
<i>measures of capacity</i>, as pints, quarts, pecks, bushels,
<i>&amp;c.</i> <i>Measures of application</i>, mentioned in Scripture,
are these that follow (in which there might be
no deceit; the ground of these measures was the
breadth of so many, or so many barley corns middle
sized, laid by one another) ‎‏אצבע‏‎ <i>Etsbang</i>, <i>Digitus</i>, <i>a
finger, an inch</i>.<a name="FNanchor_761" id="FNanchor_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> It containeth the breadth of six barley
corns joyned together where they are thickest:

in accurate speaking <i>four fingers make three inches</i>.<a name="FNanchor_762" id="FNanchor_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a>

<p>‎‏אמה‏‎ <i>Amma</i>, <i>Cubitus</i>, <i>a Cubit</i>. We shall find in Authors
mention of <i>four kinds of Cubits</i>. 1. <i>Cubitus
communi</i>, this was the measure from the elbow to
the fingers end. It contained a foot and half, or <i>half a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
a yard</i>, it is called the <i>common Cubit</i>. 2. <i>Cubitus sacer</i>,
<i>An holy Cubit</i>, this was a full <i>yard</i>, containing <i>two of
the common Cubits</i>, as appeareth by comparing <i>1 Kin.
7. 15.</i> with <i>2 Chron. 3. 15.</i> In the first place, the pillars
are reckoned each of them <i>eighteen cubits</i> high: in
the second place they are reckoned <i>five and thirty cubits</i>
high; which, together with the basis, being one
ordinary cubit high, <i>doubleth the number</i>: so that the
first Text is to be understood of <i>holy cubites</i>; the second
of <i>common cubits</i>. 3. <i>Cubitus regis</i>, the <i>Kings cubit</i>;
this was <i>three fingers longer than the common cubit</i>:<a name="FNanchor_764" id="FNanchor_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a>
Whereas the common cubit is termed <i>cubitus viri</i>,
the <i>cubit of a man</i>, <i>Deut. 3. 11.</i> <i>Onkelos</i> doth improperly
term it, <i>cubitum regis</i>, the <i>Kings cubit</i>. <i>Lastly</i>,
there was <i>cubitus geometricus</i>, <i>A geometrical cubit</i>, it
contained <i>six common cubits</i>,<a name="FNanchor_765" id="FNanchor_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> and according to
<i>these cubits</i>, it is thought that <i>Noah’s Ark was built</i>.</p>

<p>Some make the difference between the <i>cubit of the

to deceipt than the <i>Rope</i>, because it could not be

<p>To these may be added other <i>measures</i>, wherewith
they measured their <i>wayes</i> and <i>walks</i>. The least of
these was ‎‏צגד‏‎ <i>Tsagad</i>, <i>passus</i>, <i>a pace</i>.</p>

<p>Στάδιον, <i>Stadium</i>, <i>a furlong</i>. It is often mentioned in

<i>one hundred twenty five paces</i>,<a name="FNanchor_769" id="FNanchor_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> which is the

<p><i>Milliarium</i>, <i>a mile</i>; It containeth with us a <i>thousand
paces</i>, but much more among the <i>Hebrews</i>. Their
word ‎‏ברה‏‎ <i>Barah</i>, translated often <i>Milliarium</i>, properly
signifying a <i>dinner</i> or <i>meal</i>, and being applyed
unto <i>journeys</i>, <i>walks</i> or <i>ways</i>, it signified so much
ground as usually is gone, or conveniently may be
travelled in half a day, between <i>meal</i> and <i>meal</i>, or
<i>bait</i> and <i>bait</i>. The word is read, <i>Gen. 35. 16.</i> When
there was (‎‏כברת הארץ‏‎ <i>Cibrath haarets</i>) <i>about half a
daies journey of ground</i>. The <i>Greek</i> in that place hath

<p>Their <i>measures of capacity</i>, termed <i>Mensuræ capacitatis</i>,
were of <i>two sorts</i>; some for <i>dry things</i> as Corn,
Seed, <i>&amp;c.</i> Some for <i>liquid things</i>, as Wine, Oyl, <i>&amp;c.</i>
In both, that there might be a just proportion observed,
all their measures were designed by a set number
of <i>Hens eggs-shells of a middle size</i>.</p>

<p>In my parallelling of them with our measures,
where I speak of <i>Bushels, half Bushels, Pecks</i>, &amp;c. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>

was so great, that a <i>fourth part of a Kab of Doves dung</i>

<p>The <i>shekels of the Sanctuary</i> were of <i>two stamps</i>. The

side, the <i>pot of Manna</i>, or as others think, <i>Aarons censer</i>
or <i>Incense-cup</i>: the inscription on this side was ‎‏שקל ישראל‏‎
<i>Shekel Israel</i>, <i>The shekel of Israel</i>: on the reverse side
was stampt <i>Aarons Rod budding</i>, with this inscription about
the Coyn ‎‏ירושלים הקדושה‏‎ <i>Jeruschalaiim hakeduscha</i>.

pole, which three letters made his name <i>Jesu</i>. On the
reverse side there was no picture, but the whole rundle
was filled with this inscription, ‎‏משיח מלך בא בשלום ואור מאדם עשוי חי‏‎
(i.) <i>Messias rex venit cum pace,
&amp; lux de homine facta est vita</i>. In some Coyns, for the

<p>The <i>King’s shekel</i>, in <i>David</i> and <i>Solomon</i>’s time, had

<p>Their sums were <i>two</i> ‎‏מנה‏‎ <i>Maneh</i>, μνᾶ <i>Mina</i>, a <i>Pound</i>.

<i>three pound</i> of gold went to one shield. Now we
read, <i>2 Chron. 9. 16.</i> <i>Three hundred shekels</i> of gold
went to one shield. The name <i>shekels</i> is not expressed
in the Original, but necessarily understood, as appeareth
in that which was spoken of <i>Zahab</i>. For it is a received
rule, that in Scripture, <i>Aurum</i> being put with a
<i>numeral</i> signifieth so many <i>shekels of gold</i>; and so <i>Argentum</i>
in like manner. The weight thereof then being
<i>100 shekels</i>, it followeth, that the value was 75 <i>l.</i> In <i>silver</i>,
their <i>Maneh</i> weighed <i>60 shekels</i>, <i>Ezek. 45. 12.</i> so that
it valued 7 <i>l.</i> 10 <i>s.</i> Note, that <i>Sheindler</i><a name="FNanchor_796" id="FNanchor_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> was deceived,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
in saying, that the price or value of the <i>Maneh</i> was
changed in <i>Ezekiels</i> time, because it then valued 60
<i>shekels</i>: for the difference is not between the sacred &amp;
profane <i>Maneh</i>, as <i>Sheindler</i> conceives, but <i>between</i> the
<i>Maneh</i> of gold, which was valued at <i>100 shekels</i> always,
and the <i>Maneh</i> of silver, which weighed <i>60 shekels</i>,
according to the forequoted place in <i>Ezekiel</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_796" id="Footnote_796"></a><a href="#FNanchor_796"><span class="label">[796]</span></a> <i>Sheindler in ‎‏מנה‏‎</i></p>

</div>

<p>The second sum was ‎‏ככר‏‎ <i>Cicar</i>, <i>Talentum</i>, <i>A Talent</i>.
This, if it were of <i>silver</i>, it contained in weight
<i>3000 shekels</i>. For, those two verses being compared
together, <i>Exod. 38. 25, 26.</i> sheweth, that <i>six hundred
thousand</i> men paying every man <i>half a shekel</i>, the whole
sum amounted to an <i>hundred talents</i>; whence it followeth,
that a <i>talent of silver</i> amongst the <i>Hebrews</i>
was 375 <i>l.</i> But a <i>talent of gold</i> (the proportion of
gold to silver being observed) was twelve times as
much, so that it valued of ours 4500 <i>l.</i></p>

<p>In this tract of their Coyns we are to know <i>three
things</i>. First, that as the <i>Romans</i>, in the former ages, used
<i>Æs grave</i>, <i>Bullion money</i>, unstampt, which in the <i>Mass</i>
or <i>Billot</i> they weighed out in their payments, and afterward
<i>Æs signatum</i>, <i>coyned metals</i>: so the <i>Hebrews</i>
though at last they used, <i>coyned money</i>, yet at first they
<i>weighed their mony uncoyned</i>; <i>Abraham weighed to Ephron
the silver</i>, <i>Gen. 23. 6.</i> Hence the <i>shekel</i> had its <i>name from</i>
‎‏שקל‏‎ <i>Shakal</i>, <i>ponderare, librare</i>, <i>to weigh</i>, or <i>put in the
ballance</i>. <i>Secondly</i>, as the coyned <i>shekel was twofold, one</i>
for the use of the <i>Sanctuary</i>; the other for the use of the
<i>Commonwealth</i>; and that of the <i>Sanctuary</i> was double
the price of the <i>other</i>; so the <i>weight of the shekel</i> to be
distinguisht after the same manner; the <i>shekel of the
Sanctuary weighed half an ounce Troy weight; the common
shekel</i> weighed <i>a quarter of an ounce</i>. For example,
<i>Goliahs spears head weighed 600 shekels of the Sanctuary</i>
<i>1 Sam. 17. 7.</i> that is, <i>twenty five pound weight</i>: <i><span class="antiqua">Absalom’s</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
hair weighed two hundred shekels after the Kings weight</i>,
<i>2 Sam. 14. 26.</i> that is, <i>four pound weight and two ounces</i>.
Yea, the sums which I have reckoned only <i>according
to the Sanctuary</i>, in common use, <i>according to the
King’s weight</i>, they abate half their value.</p>

<p>3. The lesser coyns were in general termed κέρματα or
in the singular number κέρμα, <i>Joh. 2. 15.</i> The word signifieth
properly a small quantity or little piece of metal,
such as may be clipt off from coyns. <i>Upon the first of the
mon. <span class="antiqua">Adar</span>, Procla. was made throughout Israel, that the
people shold provide their half shekels, w<sup>ch</sup> were yearly paid
toward the service of the Temple</i>, according to the commandment
of <i>God</i>, <i>Ex. 30. 13.</i><a name="FNanchor_797" id="FNanchor_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> On the 25. of <i>Adar</i>,<a name="FNanchor_798" id="FNanchor_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> then
they <i>brought tables</i> into the <i>Temple</i> (that is, into the <i>outward
Court</i> where the <i>people stood</i>) on these <i>tables</i> lay
these κέρματα, or <i>lesser coyns</i>, to furnish those <i>who</i> wanted
<i>half shekels</i> for their offrings, or that wanted <i>lesser pieces
of mony</i> in their payment for <i>oxen, sheep, or doves</i>, which
likewise stood there in a readiness in the same <i>court</i> to
be sold for <i>sacrifices</i>: but this <i>supply of lesser coynes</i> was
not without an <i>exchange</i> for other <i>mony or other things</i>
in lieu <i>of mony</i>, and that upon advantage. Hence those
that sat at these <i>tables</i>, as chief <i>bankers</i> or <i>masters of the
exchange</i>, they were termed Κερματισταὶ, in respect of the
<i>lesser coyns</i> which they exchanged: in respect of the <i>exchange
it self</i>, they were termed Κολλυβισταὶ, for Κόλλυβος
signifieth the same in <i>Greek</i> as <i>Cambium</i> in <i>Latine</i>,<a name="FNanchor_799" id="FNanchor_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a>
whence those <i>Letters of exchange</i>, which the <i>Latines</i>
call <i>Literas Cambii</i>, the <i>Greek</i> call σύμβολα κολλυβιστικὰ,
<i>Tickets of exchange</i>: in respect of the <i>Tables</i> at which
they sate, they are termed by the <i>Talmudists</i> ‎‏שולחנים‏‎,
<i>Schulcanim</i> from ‎‏שולחן‏‎ <i>Schulchan</i> <i>Mensa</i>; for the same
reason they are sometimes termed by the <i>Greeks</i> τραπεζίται,
and by the <i>Latines Mensarii</i>. These are those
<i>changers of money</i> which our <i>Saviour</i> drove out of the
<i>Temple</i>.</p>

This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:

Produced by Jeff G., cbgrf and the Online Distributed
Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net (This book was
produced from scanned images of public domain material
from the Google Books project.)

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

    Chief Executive and Director

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
